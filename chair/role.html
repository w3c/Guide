<h1>Role of the Group Chair</h1>

The W3C Director appoints (or re-appoints) a Chair (or more than one co-Chair) for every Working
Group and Interest Group ("Group"). The Chair's primary role is to
facilitate <a href="/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">consensus</a>-building among Group members. The Chair works together with
 the W3C <a href=
"../teamcontact/role.html">Staff Contact</a>. Key roles of the Group
Chair are listed below. Additional information on the role of the
Group Chair is in the <a href="/Consortium/Process/#general-requirements">W3C Process
Document</a>.

<h2>What to look for when choosing a chair</h2>
<p><em>The following bullets based on suggestions from <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/">Joseph
  Reagle</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience in chairing similar groups, committees, and/or
conferences;</li>
<li>Previous participation or technical contributions in related
communities;</li>
<li>Ability to satisfy the time commitment (from you and/or your
organization/management);</li>
<li>Familiarity and/or willingness to learn W3C Process and
document formatting rules;</li>
<li>Ability to keep the Working Group "in Charter", both for
technical and IPR issues;</li>
<li>Ability (both actual and perceived by the Working Group --
including potential competitors) to forge consensus fairly and
without bias from your affiliation/employer and, sometimes, even
your own technical positions.</li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%" />
  <p>The team contact should
arrange for the Chair and the Director to meet (by phone if necessary) to make sure
they're on the same wavelength about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the group's work fits into <a href="/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></li>
<li>where does it fit with other groups</li>
<li>testing, test suites ... generating tests as you come to
each</li>
<li>responsibility not just to the group -- working toward consensus
of the whole community</li>
<li>cost of delaying wider consensus - negotiating your reviews and
really getting in touch with people - versus time to market and specification relevance</li>
<li>formal objections, i.e. the tricky bits of W3C process</li>
  </ul>
