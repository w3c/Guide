The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Process#ref-for-team%E2%91%A2%E2%91%A6">W3C Team</a> appoints (or re-appoints) a Chair (or more than one co-Chair) for every Working
Group and Interest Group ("Group"). The Chair's primary role is to

Chair are listed below. Additional information on the role of the
Group Chair is in the <a href="/policies/process/#general-requirements">W3C Process

<h3>What to look for when choosing a chair</h3>
<p><em>The following bullets based on suggestions from <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Reagle/">Joseph
  Reagle</a></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Experience in chairing similar groups, committees, and/or
conferences;</li>
<li>Previous participation or technical contributions in related
communities;</li>
<li>Ability to satisfy the time commitment (from you and/or your
organization/management);</li>
<li>Familiarity or willingness to learn W3C Process and
document formatting rules;</li>
<li>Familiarity with the <a href="/policies/code-of-conduct/">W3C
  Code of Conduct</a>;</li>
<li>Ability to keep the Working Group "in Charter", both for
technical and IPR issues;</li>
<li>Ability (both actual and perceived by the Working Group --
including potential competitors) to forge consensus fairly and
without bias from your affiliation/employer and, sometimes, even
your own technical positions.</li>
</ul>
<hr style="width:100%">
  <p>The team contact should
arrange for the Chair and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Process#ref-for-team%E2%91%A2%E2%91%A6">W3C Team</a> to meet (by phone if necessary) to make sure
they're on the same wavelength about things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>where the group's work fits into <a href="/TR/webarch/">Web Architecture</a></li>
<li>where does it fit with other groups</li>
<li>testing, test suites ... generating tests as you come to
each</li>
<li>responsibility not just to the group -- working toward consensus
of the whole community</li>
<li>cost of delaying wider consensus - negotiating your reviews and
really getting in touch with people - versus time to market and specification relevance</li>
<li>formal objections, i.e. the tricky bits of W3C process</li>
  </ul>
