<p>This manual is a guide containing best current practice, written for editors and authors of W3C technical reports. No requirements
for W3C publications are in this document. All requirements for W3C

<section  id="Introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Written for editors and authors of W3C technical reports, this
document assumes that the reader has mastered publishing on the W3C Web
site, and is familiar with the <cite>Style Guide for Online
Hypertext</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-STYLE-GUIDE">STYLE-GUIDE</a></cite>]. It is a companion to the
REQUIRED <cite>Technical Report Publication
Policy</cite> [<cite><a href="#ref-PUBRULES">PUBRULES</a></cite>],
called "pubrules" for short. Following the advice in this manual has
benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Non-native English readers, native English readers, and translators
will find your text easy to read and implement.</li>

<li>All audiences can concentrate on ideas rather than the mechanics of
reading.</li>

<li>Polished at early public maturity levels, clean copy eliminates
multiple "typo" reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>Chapter 2 covers <a href="#Validation">validation</a>. Chapters 3
and 4 cover <a href="#Accessibility">accessibility</a> and <a href=
"#I18n">internationalization</a>. Chapter 5 describes <a href=
"#Parts">parts</a> of a W3C technical report. Chapters 6, 7, and 8
cover <a href="#Errata">errata</a>, <a href=
"#References">references</a> and <a href="#Revisions">revisions</a>.
Chapter 9 introduces <a href="#Production">editing tools</a>.
Chapter 10 addresses Normative and Informative requirements, in particular  <a href=
"#RFC"><abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2119 key
words</a>. Chapter 11 presents <a href="#Editorial">editorial
guidelines</a>, and, finally, chapter 12 documents commonly <a href=
"#Terms">misspelled terms</a>.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that our reports are used as world-class primary
reference material. Readability across a wide variety of browsers and
platforms is far more important than using jazzy features. At some
point, what we write becomes history and is preserved on the Web
through the W3C <cite><a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Persistence">Persistence
Policy</a></cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-PERSISTENCE">PERSISTENCE</a></cite>].</p>
</section>
<section id="Validation">
<h2>Validation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure there are no broken links in your documents at the time
of publication. Some services on the Web may help you with this,
including the <cite>W3C Link Checker</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CHECKLINK">CHECKLINK</a></cite>]. Append ",checklink" to a W3C
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> to invoke the link
checker.</li>

<li>Make sure your technical report validates in the <cite>W3C Markup
Validation Service</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-VALIDATE">VALIDATE</a></cite>]. Append ",validate" to a W3C
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> to invoke the
validator.</li>

<li>Make sure your technical report validates in the <cite>W3C
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Validation
Service</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CSSVALIDATE">CSSVALIDATE</a></cite>]. Append ",cssvalidate" to a
W3C <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> to invoke the
<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> validator.</li>

<li>Make sure any examples in your document validate as well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note.</strong> It is the editor's responsibility to ensure
that documents are valid before requesting publication.</p>
</section>
<section id="Accessibility">
<h2>Accessibility</h2>

<ul>
<li>Follow the <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a></cite>
(<abbr>WCAG</abbr>). Can
simpler words express your ideas? Is your text marked up with
structural elements? Are alternatives provided for auditory and visual
content? See also <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/eval/Overview.html">evaluation tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="I18n">
<h2>Internationalization</h2>

<p>Follow the <cite>Character Model for the World Wide Web 1.0:
Fundamentals</cite> W3C work in progress [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a></cite>]. Does your specification define
protocols or format elements? If it does, define when conversion to
legal <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> reference
characters takes place, and do so as late as possible.</p>

<section id="Unicode">
<h3>Unicode</h3>

<p>When specifying characters, refer to <cite>The Unicode
Standard</cite>; see <a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-RefUnicode" title=
"Section 8 of the Character Model">section 8</a> of the <cite>Character
Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a></cite>]. The Unicode Consortium gives
guidelines for how to cite their standards; see [<cite><a href=
"#ref-UNICODE">UNICODE</a></cite>]. Refer to individual characters in
any of three ways; see the email thread <cite>"Unicode character
names"</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CHARNAMES">CHARNAMES</a></cite>]:</p>

<ol>
<li>by codepoint (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
<code>U+002E</code>)</li>

<li>by formal Unicode name (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
<span class="UnicodeName">full stop</span>); see [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CHARTS">CHARTS</a></cite>]</li>

<li>by Unicode alias (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, <span class=
"UnicodeAlias">dot</span>, or <span class="UnicodeAlias">decimal
point</span>, or <span class="UnicodeAlias">period</span>); see
[<cite><a href="#ref-CHARTS">CHARTS</a></cite>]</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="Translations">
<h3>Translations</h3>

<p>W3C has no official translations of its technical reports. W3C does
encourage people to translate the technical reports and helps to track
translators and translations.</p>

<ul>
<li>A central translation page includes links to pages that document
translations of particular specifications [<cite><a href=
"#ref-TRANSLATE">TRANSLATE</a></cite>].</li>

<li>Read the <cite>W3C Intellectual Property <abbr title=
"Frequently Asked Questions list">FAQ</abbr></cite>, <cite><a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#translate">Can I
translate one of your specifications into another language?</a></cite>
and <cite><a href=
"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Legal/IPR-FAQ-20000620#official">Can I
create the "official" translation?</a></cite> ([<cite><a href=
"#ref-IPRFAQ">IPRFAQ</a></cite>] sections 5.6 and 5.7).</li>
</ul>

<p>Although technical reports are written in U.S. English, examples and
wording should not rely on conventions and idioms used only in the
United States (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, "<abbr title=
"U.S. Postal Service abbr for Zone Improvement Plan">ZIP</abbr>
code"). Use international examples (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
"postal code") wherever possible.</p>

<p>Make your specification more readable by adding markup to
distinguish common words from keywords in your language. Mark up every
occurrence. For example:</p>
<pre>
The title attribute of these elements
may be used to provide the full
or expanded form of the expression.
</pre>

<p>becomes:</p>
<pre>
The &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute of these elements
may be used to provide the full
or expanded form of the expression.
</pre>

<p>A French translator would then know not to translate <em>title</em>
to <em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">titre</em>.</p>

<p>First person pronouns ("I," "we") which are hard to translate should
not be used in the text of examples. See the email message
<cite>"Personal pronouns in specifications"</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-PRONOUNS">PRONOUNS</a></cite>]. Avoid "my" and "me" in examples
(<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, use "userResource" and not
"myResource").</p>

<p>Specifications should not directly address the reader as well.
Translating second person singular pronouns is a hard task if the
language distinguishes between various forms like formal and informal
of "you," hence avoid "you."</p>

<p>Do not invent elements to replace natural language. For example, do
not use <code>&lt;must/&gt;</code> and a stylesheet to render MUST.
Other languages may need grammatical agreement with the sentence's
subject, <span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, in French, MUST will become
<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">DOIT</em> if the subject is singular, or
<em xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">DOIVENT</em> if it is plural. Use standard
markup instead.</p>
</section>
<section id="Dates">
<h3>Style for Dates</h3>

<p>5/6/03 to denote a date is ambiguous in the international context
(the example could mean 6 May or 5 June). Either spell out the month (6
May 2003) or use an ISO-8601-derived form (2003-05-06). <cite><a href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-2-20010502/#date" title=
"Section 3.2.9 of the XML Schema Datatypes">XML Schema Part 2:
Datatypes</a></cite> ([<cite><a href=
"#ref-SCHEMA-DATATYPES">SCHEMA-DATATYPES</a></cite>], sections 3.2.9
through 3.2.14.1) formally explains how to write dates in XML
documents.</p>

<h3>Editors and Authors</h3>

<section id="affs">
<h4>Managing Changing Affiliations</h4>

<p>Editor/Author affiliations change over time. Here are examples that
illustrate the suggested approach for managing them.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Still editor</dt>

<dd>Richard Ishida, W3C (and before at Xerox)</dd>

<dd>François Yergeau, Invited Expert (and before at Alis

</dl>
</section>
</section>
<section id="tAbstract">
  <h3>Abstract</h3>

<p><dfn id="must-abstract">Give each document an
Abstract</dfn> (a few paragraphs at most) that summarizes what the
document is about. The Communications Team may use the Abstract as a
whole or in part to publicize your work. Write it for a non-technical
audience.</p>
</section>
<section id="Status">
  <h3>Status Section</h3>

<p>The "Status of This Document" section describes the document status
and publication context on the publication date. Pubrules
[<cite><a href="#ref-PUBRULES">PUBRULES</a></cite>] states the
requirements for the status section of each type of technical report
(e.g., use of customized and boilerplate text).</p>

<p>Since the status section does not change over time, express it in
terms that will be valid over time (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
avoid the word "new"). Indicate the anticipated stability of the
document while recognizing that the future is unknown. Readers are
responsible for discovering the latest status information (<span class=
"not-en">e.g.</span>, by following the latest version link, or visiting
the W3C technical reports index [<cite><a href=
"#ref-TR">TR</a></cite>].</p>

<p>The custom paragraph is very important as it actually contains
information! In it, you should explain where a part of the energy of
the group has been invested. The custom paragraph should help a reader
decide "I really should read this draft." This implies that you
shouldn't paste it in from somewhere else. It should be very specific
to this document.</p>

<p>TimBL expressed the goal of the custom paragraph this way, "Don't be
afraid of being honest about the relevant techno-political situation."
In the custom paragraph, make th case for why someone should read this
draft.</p>

<p>In the custom paragraph, include what you would reply to a Member or
colleague who asked you such things as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are we requesting that people implement this specification? If so,
where should experience reports be sent?</li>

<li>Are we requesting people do <em>not</em> implement the
specification until a later date? What sort of damage do we expect to
inflict on those who do by future changes to the document?</li>

<li>Does it reflect the consensus of a W3C Working Group? (Pay
attention to the authors and acknowledgments.)</li>

<li>Are there any changes expected?</li>

<li>Do we maintain a page of background information?</li>

<li>For pre-release drafts, state in the status section any limits on
redistribution, such as "Member confidential."</li>
</ul>

<section id="Errata">
  <h2>Errata</h2>

<p>All Recommendations have errors in them. They link to an errata page
that evolves over time. Since the errata page changes over time but a
specific version of a Recommendation does not, place the errata page
<strong>outside</strong> of the <kbd>/TR</kbd> hierarchy. There is an
expectation that documents in the "<abbr title=
"technical report">TR</abbr> zone" will not evolve over time
[<cite><a href="#ref-PERSISTENCE">PERSISTENCE</a></cite>]. For example,
locate errata pages in the portion of the Web space dedicated to the
relevant Working Group or Activity.</p>

<p>Clearly indicate on the errata page:</p>

<ul>
<li>The last modified date for the errata page.</li>

<li>The <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> of the
source document (<span class="not-en">i.e.</span>, the one with the
errata).</li>

<li>Where to find the latest version of the source document.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example (shown here without links):</p>

<dl style="margin-left: 10%">
<dt>This document:</dt>

<dd>http://www.w3.org/Style/css2-updates/REC-CSS2-19980512-errata</dd>

<dt>Last revised:</dt>

<dd>$Date: 2016/07/10 16:55:10 $</dd>

<dt>This document records known errors in the document:</dt>

<dd>http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-CSS2-19980512</dd>

<dt>The latest version of the CSS 2 Recommendation:</dt>

<dd>http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2</dd>
</dl>

<p>On the errata page, list the newest entries nearer to the top.</p>

<section id='entries'>
<h3>Entries on an errata
page</h3>

<p>For each entry on the errata page, provide:</p>

<ol>
<li>A unique identifier</li>

<li>The date it was added to the errata page</li>

<li>A classification of the error (e.g., editorial, clarification, bug,
known problem with the document itself)</li>

<li>A short description of the problem and what part of the
Recommendation is affected.</li>

<li>Any proposed corrections and whether those corrections would affect
conformance of documents or software</li>

<li>Any normative corrections; see the section on <a href=
"https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#errata">Errata
Management</a> in the <cite>W3C Process Document</cite>
([<cite><a href="#ref-PROCESS">PROCESS</a></cite>] section 6.7.1) for
more information about normative corrections</li>
</ol>

<p>Do no remove entries from the errata page; if a correction turns out
to be incorrect, just add another entry (with a cross reference).</p>

<section id="extractor">
  <h3>Bibliography Extractor</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.specref.org/">SpecRef</a> tool, an Open-Source, Community-Maintained Database of
Web Standards &amp; Related References, contains an exhaustive of references.</p>

<p>The <cite><a href=

Extractor</a></cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-BIB-EXTRACT">BIB-EXTRACT</a></cite>] will automatically generate
a list of references in W3C style.</p>

</section>
<section id="citation">
  <h3>Citation</h3>

<p>Reference links (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, "[<abbr title=
"Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>]") link at least the first mention of a source to the References
section and take the form:</p>
<pre>
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.example.org/example"&gt;Full Name&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt; [&lt;cite&gt;&lt;a href="#ref-REFNAME"&gt;REFNAME&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;]
</pre>

<p>Parentheses around square brackets can be omitted unless the
parentheses would contain a section number.</p>

<p>References links occur at minimum at the first mention of the
source. Spell out what the reference link refers to at least in the
first occurrence, <span class="not-en">e.g.</span>:</p>
<pre>
This is discussed in <cite>Namespaces in XML</cite> [XMLName].

<section id="linking-within">
  <h3>Citing a Reference From Within a Document</h3>

<p>When linking from the middle of the document to an external
resource:</p>

<ol>
<li>Ensure that the link text, title, and context indicate you are
leaving the document, and</li>

<li>After the link, link to the reference in the references section,
and indicate section, page, or whatever is useful for those when the
link is unavailable (e.g., when printed).</li>
</ol>

<p>Thus, for example:</p>
<pre>
...as is done for the <a href=
"https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-CSS2-20110607/ui.html#propdef-outline"
title=
"Section 18.3 of CSS 2">'outline' property of CSS2</a> ([<cite><a href=
"#ref-CSS2">CSS2</a></cite>], section 18.3).
</pre>
</section>
<section id="ref-section">
  <h3>References Section</h3>

<ul>
<li>All entries in a references section should be referred to in the
prose. If an entry is not referred to from the body of the document,
make it clear why it is in the References section.</li>

<li>If a reference is a W3C Recommendation track technical report that
has not reached Recommendation, state in the References section that it
is "work in progress."</li>

<li>It is helpful to include references to both persistent resources
and their latest version. Use titles for links. If there is an
institutionalized identifier (<abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>) for a document, cite the most
specific identifier. For example, usually you would link the title to
<kbd>http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224</kbd> rather than
to <kbd>http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/</kbd>. For more information on
using versioned and unversioned identifiers, refer to the
<cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/charmod/#sec-RefUnicode">Character
Model for the World Wide Web 1.0: Fundamentals</a></cite>
([<cite><a href="#ref-CHARMOD">CHARMOD</a></cite>] section 8).</li>

<li>An entry in a references section takes this form:

<ul>
<li>Title, inside <code>a</code> (if available), inside
<code>cite</code></li>

<li>Comma-delimited list of authors' names</li>

<li>If there are no authors, use editors instead if available.
Following the last family name, say "eds." or "Editors."</li>

<li>Publisher, followed by the date of publication in the form DD Month
YYYY</li>

<li>A sentence containing a text-only <abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.</li>

<li>When available, a sentence ending in the latest version
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr></li>
</ul>

      <h3>Normative &amp; Informative sections</h3>

  <p>It is important that informative (non-normative) material
    is clearly distinguished from normative material. To this end:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the entire document is informative, say so at the top and
        do not reference RFC 2119 or use <a href="#RFC">RFC 2119 keywords</a>
      </li>
      <li>If some sections are informative, say so at the
        start of each section, and do not
        use <a href="#RFC">RFC 2119 keywords</a> in those sections
      </li>
      <li>Figures, examples and notes are assumed to always be informative.
        To avoid repetition, each figure, example or note does not say this.

<section id="Editorial">
  <h2>Editorial Guidelines</h2>

<p>This section refers to editorial practice at W3C. It touches on
grammar, spelling, punctuation, case, linking, appearance and
markup.</p>

<section id="Grammar">
  <h3>Grammar</h3>

<ul>
<li>Delete repeated words.</li>

<li>Check subject-verb agreement.</li>

<li>Break long sentences.</li>

<li>Eliminate contractions (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, "don't"
should read "do not")?</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="Spelling">
  <h3>Spelling</h3>

<ul>
<li>Spell-check using a U.S. English dictionary. Append ",spell" to a
W3C <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> to invoke
W3C's spell checker.</li>

<li>Free dictionaries are also available on the <a title=
"Ispell home page at UCLA" href=
"http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/ispell.html">Ispell home
page</a> [<cite><a href="#ref-ISPELL">ISPELL</a></cite>] for UNIX and
the <a title="Excalibur home page at Bucknell" href=
"http://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~excalibr/excalibur.html">Excalibur home
page</a> [<cite><a href="#ref-EXCAL">EXCAL</a></cite>] for Mac OS.</li>

<li>W3C uses <cite>Merriam-Webster's
Collegiate<sup><small>®</small></sup> Dictionary</cite>, 10th Edition
[<cite><a href="#ref-M-W">M-W</a></cite>], on the Web as the spelling
arbiter because it is free, on-line, and available to every technical
report author and editor. If a word does not appear there, use the
<cite>American Heritage<sup><small>®</small></sup> Dictionary</cite>,
4th Edition [<cite><a href="#ref-AH">AH</a></cite>]. Other dictionaries
are used as needed (for example, Random House and Webster's unabridged,
Oxford and Oxford Concise).</li>

<li>W3C uses U.S. English (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
"standardise" should read "standardize" and "behaviour" should read
"behavior").</li>

<li>Form the plural of abbreviations, initialisms and acronyms without
an apostrophe (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, the plural of
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> is <abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifiers">URIs</abbr> not <abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifiers">URI's</abbr>). See the FAQ
<cite>"Infrequently Asked Questions Concerning the Proper Spelling of
'DTD' in its Plural Form"</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-PLURAL">PLURAL</a></cite>].</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="Punctuation">
  <h3>Punctuation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use correct punctuation. A hard copy of <cite>The Chicago Manual of
Style</cite> or <cite>The Gregg Reference Manual</cite> may be of some
help.</li>

<li>Remember you are typing <abbr title=
"HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> or <abbr title=
"Extensible Markup Language">XML</abbr> not TeX. Use quotation marks
rather than grave accents and apostrophes to quote text (<span class=
"not-en">e.g.</span>, ``value'' should read "value").</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Case">
  <h3>Case, Combining Words, and Hyphenation</h3>

<ul>
<li>Capitalize W3C entities to match the <cite>W3C Process
Document</cite> [<cite><a href="#ref-PROCESS">PROCESS</a></cite>]
(<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, Working Group, Recommendation).</li>

<li>Make the case, number of words, and hyphenation in terms match
<a href="#Terms">chapter 12</a>.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Misc">
  <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<ul>
<li>Spell out acronyms and initialisms in their first occurrence in
prose, for example, "Internet Engineering Task Force
(<abbr>IETF</abbr>)" or "Internationalization (<abbr>I18N</abbr>)." In
subsequent occurrences when they are not spelled out, use
<code>abbr</code> elements, and give them
<code>title</code> attributes.</li>

<li>Check references (most commonly, for no full stop after the
<span class="not-en" xml:lang="la" lang="la">et</span> in et al.). Do
the entries match?</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Linking">
  <h3>Linking</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unless intentionally referring to the latest document in a series,
always refer to specific W3C documents by using the "this version"
<abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>.</li>

<li>If you are referring to a W3C document using either its this
version or latest version <abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>, note whether the <abbr title=
"Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> ends in a slash or not. These
identifiers do not end in an extension such as "<kbd>.html</kbd>".
Include the extension when intentionally referring to a specific
version (e.g., a <abbr title=
"Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> image where <abbr title=
"Graphics Interchange Format">GIF</abbr> and <abbr title=
"Portable Network Graphics">PNG</abbr> are both available through
content negotiation).</li>

<li>Visible <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s and
<code>href</code> attributes should have the same value.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="Examples">
  <h3>Using Examples</h3>

<ul>
<li>Domains in examples adhere to section 3, "Reserved Example Second
Level Domain Names," in <cite><abbr title=
"Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2606</cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-DOMAINS">DOMAINS</a></cite>]. Use the domains
<kbd>example.com</kbd>, <kbd>example.org</kbd>, and
<kbd>example.net</kbd> for all examples. The Internet Assigned Numbers
Authority (IANA) reserves them for this purpose. If you need an
evocative name or the name of a business, use a machine name (<span
class="not-en">e.g.</span>, <kbd>http://cats.example.org</kbd>).</li>

<li>When not addressed by second level example domains, top level
domains (<abbr title="top level domain">TLD</abbr>s) adhere to section
2, "TLDs for Testing, &amp; Documentation Examples," in
<cite><abbr title="Request for Comments">RFC</abbr> 2606</cite>
[<cite><a href="#ref-DOMAINS">DOMAINS</a></cite>]. Use
<kbd>.test</kbd>, <kbd>.example</kbd>, <kbd>.invalid</kbd> or
<kbd>.localhost</kbd>.</li>

<li>Remember to validate markup in examples. Escaped characters pass
through routine validation.</li>

<li>W3C publications are copyrighted by W3C, and W3C liability,
trademark and document use rules apply. Note that in general, one
should not use material (text, photo, audio) in examples when the
copyright is not held by W3C. If the group wishes to publish
copyrighted materials, it should contact the Team legal staff (team-legal@w3.org).</li>

<li>
<p>Use <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> with
<code>div</code> elements to mark up examples, as is done in the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/document-metadata.html#example-2ced58ee"
title="Section 4.2. Document metadata">HTML 5.1</a>
([<cite><a href="#ref-HTML">HTML</a></cite>], section
4.2):</p>
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Images">
  <h3>Images</h3>

<ul>
<li>We recommend that each image be available as PNG, even if you use
content negotiation to serve alternative formats.</li>

<li>Give images a background color (<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>,
white) so your technical report can be read with any style sheet
(<span class="not-en">e.g.</span>, with W3C's dark on light style
sheets, or a user style sheet that specifies a dark background).</li>

<li>Match image size to markup <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> (or images will be distorted).</li>

<li>See the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20-GENERAL/">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines Techniques</a> for information about providing alternative
text (<code>alt</code>) and long descriptions (<code>longdesc</code>)
for images. Also, don't forget to spell-check your alternative
text.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Markup">
  <h3>Markup</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use markup as it is intended. The <code>blockquote</code> and
<code>ul</code> and <code>li</code> elements were designed for
quotations and lists and not for indentation. Use <abbr title=
"Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> instead.</li>

<li>Remove extraneous non-breaking spaces.</li>

<li>Mark up attributes and elements consistently.</li>

<li>Make sure there are no <code>font</code> or <code>basefont</code>
elements in your document.</li>

<li>Make sure all <code>table</code> elements in your document are real
data tables, not tables used for layout.</li>

<li>Make sure there are no <code>bgcolor</code>,
<code>background</code>, <code>color</code>, <code>face</code>,
<code>marginheight</code>, <code>marginwidth</code> or
<code>size</code> attributes.</li>

<li>Give each page <code>lang="en-US"</code> on the <code>html</code>
element for <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, or
<code>xml:lang="en-US" lang="en-US"</code> on the <code>html</code>
element for <abbr title=
"Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> syntax.</li>

<li>Use the <code>span</code> element and <code>lang</code> and
<code>xml:lang</code> attributes for language changes within a
page.</li>

<li>Make semantic distinctions using more than only color, for example,
a font-style change, so that color-blind individuals can see a
difference.</li>

<li>Links with the anchor text "Click here" provide no context. The
visitor may become lost not knowing where "here" is. See also
<cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/noClickHere">Don't use "click
here" as link text</a></cite> [<cite><a href=
"#ref-CLICK-HERE">CLICK-HERE</a></cite>].</li>

<li>Mark up data <code>table</code> headers with <code>th</code> not by
bolding a <code>td</code>.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="Large">
  <h3>Large Documents</h3>

<p>Large single files that may be easy to print and search may not be
easy to download. For large documents:</p>

<ul>
<li>Divide the document logically, storing chapters in separate
files.</li>

<li>Offer a single-page, printable, searchable version of the
specification. This format may be compressed if large.</li>

<li>You can offer an archived version (zip, tar, tgz) of the separate
files. Provide all necessary file in archived versions including the
relevant style sheets. Don't link to images or style sheets not
included in the archive.</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section id="inclusive">
  <h3>Inclusive terminology</h3>

<p>Following the <a 
  href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#expected-behavior">W3C Code of Conduct</a>,
<abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> specifications are expected to be
inclusive and facilitate diversity. As such, editors and authors are strongly encouraged
to use a neutral and inclusive language to ensure the best environment possible for the
whole <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> community.</p>

<p>Here are proposed alternatives for some terms that <a
