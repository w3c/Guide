      <p>
        A good practice for GitHub is to use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/">pull requests</a>.
        It lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to the repository.
        Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with
        others and add follow-up commits before the changes are merged into the repository.
      </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>
        Navigate to the repo.
      </p>
      <pre><code>cd specs-on-github</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Checkout the main branch of your repository (in general, this is the <code>master</code> branch).
      </p>
      <pre><code>git checkout master</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure the main branch is up-to-date with upstream.
      </p>
      <pre><code>git pull</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Create a new branch for your upcoming pull request (one branch per pull request). Please make branch names
        informative - by including the issue or bug number for example.
      </p>
      <pre><code>git checkout -B my-wonderful-edits-for-87</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make your edits in your favorite editor.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Add your edits to prepare your commit by staging them. Best is to use the interactive mode (New files still
        need to be added explictly).
      </p>
      <pre><code>git add -p</code></pre>
      <p>If you ignore an edit, it will be reproposed to you the next time you run the command. This allow you to make
      multiple edits at once and split them into different more meaningfull/easy-to-review commits.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Commit your staged edits. If you're fixing an issue, reference it in the commit e.g. <code>#87</code>
        (it will automatically close the issue once the commit is added in the main branch).
      </p>
      <pre><code>git commit -m "&lt;purpose of your edits>"</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once all your commits are done, push your branch upstream.
      </p>
      <pre><code> git push --set-upstream origin my-wonderful-edits-for-87</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Using your favorite browser, navigate to the repo on GitHub, e.g.
      </p>
      <pre><code>https://github.com/tobie/specs-on-github/</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once your anthenticated on the repo page, a new button should appear on the page to create a new
        pull request (<code>Compare &amp; pull request</code>). Go ahead and punch it.
      </p>
      <p><img src="img/create-a-pr.png" alt="Compare &amp; pull request" /></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Make sure you like the title of your pull request, add a proper description, and use
        <a href="spec-labels.html">proper GitHub labels</a>, add one or more reviewers so they get pinged.
        Once you're satisfied, create the pull request. Note that you can update all of those information
        after that if needed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
       ALL normative spec changes are generally expected to have a corresponding pull request in
       <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">web-platforms-tests</a>,
       either in the form of new tests or modifications to existing tests, or must include the rationale for why test
       updates are not required for the proposed update.
     </p>
     <p>
       Typically, both pull requests (spec updates and tests) will be merged at the same time. If a pull request
       for the specification is approved but the other needs more work, add the
       '<a href="https://w3c.github.io/spec-labels.html">needs tests</a>' label or,
       in web-platform-tests, the
       '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Astatus%3Aneeds-spec-decision%20">status:needs-spec-decision</a>'
       label. Note that a test change that contradicts
       the specification should not be merged before the corresponding specification change.
     </p>
     <p>
       If testing is not practical due to <a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/">web-platforms-tests</a> limitations,
       please explain why and if appropriate file an issue with the
       '<a href="https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Atype%3Auntestable%20">type:untestable</a>'
       label to follow up later.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Wait for the needed reviews. All pull requests must have been reviewed by one or more participants of the working groups.
        They can use approve changes, give you <code>+1</code>, comment, etc.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once the pull request gets enough support, it can be merged (use the <code>Squash and merge</code> to avoid cluttering the commit history). Delete your ad-hoc branch <code>my-wonderful-edits-for-87</code>. You're done.
