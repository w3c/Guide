toc: true
---

This document provides guidance for members of the W3C elected bodies: the Advisory Board (AB) and Technical Architecture Group (TAG).

## W3C elected bodies {#intro}

The [AB](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#AB) and the [TAG](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#TAG) are defined in the W3C Process, as are the [rules of participation](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#AB-TAG-participation) for both groups.

## W3C values and behaviours {#values}

Like all W3C participants, members of elected bodies are required to follow the [W3C Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/). As leaders, members of elected bodies should also consider the ways in which they can demonstrate the Code of Conduct's [expected behavior](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/#expected-behavior), and proactively respond to instances of [unacceptable behavior](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/#unacceptablebehavior).

## Communication guidelines {#guidelines}

{% include quote.html content="Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C. They are elected by the membership and [appointed by the Team](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#TAG-appointments) with the expectation that they will use their best judgement to find the best solutions for the web, not just for any network, technology, vendor, or user." footer=" W3C process " %}

As leaders within the W3C community, the opinions of members of elected bodies carry particular weight, whether they are expressed within our community or elsewhere.

As a member of an elected body:

- It is assumed you are speaking as an individual unless you state otherwise.
- If you want to express the opinion of your organisation or a group you are affiliated with, make it clear before you state their view.
- If you have multiple roles within the W3C community, for example you are a member of the AB and also a member of the Advisory Committee (AC), but your position as AB member is not the same as your position as AC representative, inform the other members of the group as a courtesy.
- Do not use phrases like "on behalf of the AB" or "the TAG thinks that" unless the group has asked you to do so.
- When you represent the elected body you are a member of, be clear that is what you are doing.
- When not speaking for the elected body you are a member of, be aware that people will still be aware of your participation. You may decide to mention your participation anyway and should do so cautiously. Here are some examples:
  
  - If you are making a comment which has nothing to do with the business of the elected body you are a member of, there is no need to mention your participation.
  - If your comment is influenced by your participation in the elected body, you may want to mention it, for example "In my experience of being on the AB...".
- You will be held to a higher standard as a result of your elected status and in recognition of your leadership within the W3C community.

## Representing formal decisions {#decisions}

When communicating a formal decision by the elected body you are a member of:

- Express clearly what was decided and what was not decided.
- Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of, with time for them to review and comment on the message before it is released.
- If time is limited because the elected body needs to respond urgently, a minimum review period of 24 hours plus review by the Chair(s) of the elected body is required.

When discussing a decision made by the elected body you are a member of:

- Be respectful about the decision, even if you did not support the consensus of the elected body.
- Be respectful of all points of view, even those that did not gain consensus.

When discussing a matter that has not reached a conclusion:

- Be clear that the discussion is ongoing and has not reached a conclusion.
- Make it clear when feedback and comments are wanted, and let people know how to do so.
- Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of before you send it.
