      <p>This document provides guidance for members of the W3C elected bodies: the Advisory Board (AB) and Technical Architecture Group (TAG).</p>

<h2 id="intro">W3C elected bodies</h2>

<p>The <a href="/policies/process/#AB">AB</a> and the <a href="/policies/process/#TAG">TAG</a> are defined in the W3C Process, as are the <a href="/policies/process/#AB-TAG-participation">rules of participation</a> for both groups.</p>

<h2 id="values">W3C values and behaviours</h2>

<p>Like all W3C participants, members of elected bodies are required to follow the <a href="/policies/code-of-conduct/">W3C Code of Conduct</a>. As leaders, members of elected bodies should also consider the ways in which they can demonstrate the Code of Conduct's <a href="/policies/code-of-conduct/#expected-behavior">expected behavior</a>, and proactively respond to instances of <a href="/policies/code-of-conduct/#unacceptablebehavior">unacceptable behavior</a>.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines">Communication guidelines</h2>

<p>As the W3C process says:</p>

<blockquote>Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C. They are elected by the membership and <a href="/policies/process/#TAG-appointments">appointed by the Team</a> with the expectation that they will use their best judgement to find the best solutions for the web, not just for any network, technology, vendor, or user.</blockquote>

<p>As leaders within the W3C community, the opinions of members of elected bodies carry particular weight, whether they are expressed within our community or elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a member of an elected body:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is assumed you are speaking as an individual unless you state otherwise.</li>
<li>If you want to express the opinion of your organisation or a group you are affiliated with, make it clear before you state their view.</li>
<li>If you have multiple roles within the W3C community, for example you are a member of the AB and also a member of the Advisory Committee (AC), but your position as AB member is not the same as your position as AC representative, inform the other members of the group as a courtesy.</li>
<li>Do not use phrases like "on behalf of the AB" or "the TAG thinks that" unless the group has asked you to do so.</li>
<li>When you represent the elected body you are a member of, be clear that is what you are doing.</li>
<li>When not speaking for the elected body you are a member of, be aware that people will still be aware of your participation. You may decide to mention your participation anyway and should do so cautiously. Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>If you are making a comment which has nothing to do with the business of the elected body you are a member of, there is no need to mention your participation.</li>
<li>If your comment is influenced by your participation in the elected body, you may want to mention it, for example "In my experience of being on the AB...".</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>You will be held to a higher standard as a result of your elected status and in recognition of your leadership within the W3C community.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decisions">Representing formal decisions</h2>

<p>When communicating a formal decision by the elected body you are a member of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express clearly what was decided and what was not decided.</li>
<li>Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of, with time for them to review and comment on the message before it is released.</li>
<li>If time is limited because the elected body needs to respond urgently, a minimum review period of 24 hours plus review by the Chair(s) of the elected body is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>When discussing a decision made by the elected body you are a member of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be respectful about the decision, even if you did not support the consensus of the elected body.</li>
<li>Be respectful of all points of view, even those that did not gain consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>When discussing a matter that has not reached a conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be clear that the discussion is ongoing and has not reached a conclusion.</li>
<li>Make it clear when feedback and comments are wanted, and let people know how to do so.</li>
<li>Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of before you send it.</li>
</ul>
