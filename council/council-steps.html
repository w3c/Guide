  <p>This document describes the different steps to resolve a Formal Objection. It should be kept synchronized with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/">W3C Process Document</a> which is the authoritative source.</p>

 <ol>

  <li>The Council Team Contact creates a new <a href="https://www.w3.org/Systems/Mail/Request/">Mailing List</a>) (name should be <em>group-council-YYYY-MM-&lt;readable shortname&gt;</em>)</li>
  <li>The Council Team Contact tries to find a Chair for the Potential Council</li>
  <li>The Council Team contact circulates the collected dismissal reasons to the Potential Council (1 week to amend or answer)</li>
  <li>The Council Team contact circulates the Team Report while point above is discussed</li>
  <li>The Council Team contact create a WBS for dismissal, with the option to self-recuse, and accept the Chair, if found; if not ask for chairs.</li>
