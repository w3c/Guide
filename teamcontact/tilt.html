<h1>Technical issues Lead Team</h1>

<p>The mission of the TiLT is to make technical team decisions described in the W3C Process. Its authority comes from delegation by the CEO.</p>

<p>The Technical issues Lead Team is meant to handle all requests and
    verifications for:</p>

    <ol>
<li>Group charters approvals, before and after AC review</li>
<li>Chairs discussions/approvals</li>
<li>Group extensions</li>
<li>Member submissions</li>
<li>Workshops(<a href='#note1'>*</a>)</li>
<li>Patent Advisory Groups (PAGs)</li>
<li>Start of Councils</li>
<li>Anything related to the operational management of developing W3C specs</li>
</ol>

<p id='note1'>(*) Those requests still need W3C Management approval in
    parallel.</p>

<p>Requests MUST be made by opening an
    <a href='https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose'>issue</a>.</p>

<p>For sensitive announcement, a draft of the message going to the AC may
    be needed. If so, use the "Anything else we should think before ..."
    to include or link to those information.</p>

<p>The <a href='https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/labels/agenda'>list
    of pending</a> requests is available.

<h3 id="out">Out of Scope</h3>

<ol>
    <li>The TiLT is “internal to the Team”; it does not have Membership- or community-facing activities. Generally speaking, project management and strategy roles carry out these Membership-and community-facing activities. However, asking approval from TiLT is a signal that can be exposed to the outside.</li>
<li>TiLT does not replace the Strategy Function (e.g., what Workshops W3C should organize). Note, however, that the TiLT does play a role for related decisions (e.g., Workshop approval).</li>
<li>TiLT does not replace Board of Directors nor W3C Management functions. For example, the TiLT does not establish a budget, but through its decisions (e.g., Workshop approval), there are likely to be budgetary impacts (e.g., Workshop costs, human resources for Team Contacts, etc.). Thus, TiLT may be asked to provide input to budget discussions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id='composition'>Composition</h2>

<p>Composition goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manageable size</li>
<li>Decision-making continuity</li>
<li>Viewpoint freshness</li>
<li>Staff development</li>

</ul>

<p>The TiLT is staffed as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>2 seats are 2-year terms, with staggered renewals every year,
    acting as co-chairs (“co-chair seat”). May need to change at
    different times.</li>
<li>3 seats are 1-year terms, with staggered renewals every 8
    months (“regular seat”)</li>
</ul>


<p>Eligibility:</p>
<ul>
    <li>By default, all Team Contacts are eligible for either co-chair or regular seats. Individuals from this group are expected to participate but may opt-out.
Other W3C Team may opt-in.</li>
<li>To fill an open seat, assemble the <a href='https://www.w3.org/2023/08/noncom-random-selection.html'>randomized list of individuals</a> interested in the position, with the outgoing TiLT member at the bottom of the list, go down the list until you fill the seat.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id='current'>Current members</h3>

<ul>
<li>PLH (May 24, 2023), Xiaoqian (May 24, 2023) (co-chairs)</li>
<li>Chris (May 24, 2023), Yves (May 24, 2023), Atsushi (September 1, 2023)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id='meetings'>Meetings</h2>

<p>The W3C Technical Lead Team (TiLT) decides whether to meet synchronously. Currently, TiLT meets every Monday, at 9am Boston time (IRC: &tilt).</p>

<p>The entire W3C team has an open invitation to observe the discussion, including attending calls. (contact plh for that)</p>

<h2 id='request'>Requesting approval from TiLT</h2>

<p>Requests for approvals MUST be sent as an <a href='https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose'>open issue</a> to tilt-private. There are templates for each type of decision request. Each request receives the label “agenda” and remains open until a decision has been reached.

<p>For requests also requiring W3M approval (such as workshop budget), the label “w3m” label is also added.

<h2 id='responses'>How TiLT responds to requests</h2>

<h3 id='support'>Expressions of support</h3>

<p>TiLT will only approve requests where there are:
<ul>
    <li>At least three expressions of support, and</li>
<li>No objections from TiLT participants. Participants may abstain.</li>
</ul>

<p>TiLT participants use +1, -1, and 0 respectively to mean support, do not support, abstain. TiLT participants register their responses as a comment in the tilt-private Github issue (last comment takes precedence).

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Comments about charter, workshop proposals, etc. (e.g., a link is broken) should be made directly in the relevant repository (e.g., strategy) unless the comment is Team-only, in which case the TiLT repo is appropriate.

<h3 id='timing'>Timing of responses</h3>

<p>TiLT responses can be expected on this schedule:
<p>Within 2 business days: approval is only possible if every TiLT
    participant has responded. During this period, TiLT participants
    may request additional time to evaluate the request.
<p>After 2 business days: approval is possible as soon as there are at
    least three expressions of support and no objections or requests for
    additional time.

<p>In cases where there are objections or requests for additional time,
    TiLT will use its weekly call to resolve differences.

<h3 id='decision'>Once TiLT has reached a decision</h3>

<p>Once the threshold for a decision has been reached, any TiLT participant may record the decision and close the GitHub issue. If approved, the issue will be “Close as completed”. If rejected, the issue will be “Closed as not planned”.

<p>If a request is approved, the requestor should consult the Guidebook on Charters for next steps.

<p>If a request is rejected, it gets sent back to the originating function.

<h2 id='communication'>Communication</h2>

<p>The recommended way to communicate with TiLT is through the tilt-private Github repository (by raising an issue or responding to one).

<p>For any request sent to TiLT, Team input is welcome in the Strategy repository. Keep in mind the Team etiquette when posting publicly. For Team confidential discussion, input is welcome in the tilt-private Github repository. Note that any +1/-1/other from non-TiLT is NOT counted to reach TiLT approval but any TiLT member may put a hold on a decision based on non-TiLT opinions.

<p>TiLT MUST provide a weekly digest of its activities to W3M.

    <p>
