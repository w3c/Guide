<h1>Role of Liaison</h1>

<p>The <a href="staff-contact">Staff Contact</a> for a Working Group, with
the <a href="chairs-role">Chair's</a> assistance, appoints a liaison as
needed where two groups have strong dependencies;
see the list of <a href="/2001/11/StdLiaison" class="navlink">W3C liaisons</a>.
The Liaison's primary
role is to facilitate resolution of the dependency between the two groups.

<P>An overall question: is there always a "Group A" &amp; "Group B," in
other words a "home" group that is having its requirements considered in
a "host" (or 'target'??) group, or is the liaisoning relationship sometimes
completely mutual?
