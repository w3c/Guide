title: Role of Liaison
toc: false
---

The [Staff Contact](role.md) for a Working Group, with the [Chair's](../chair/role.md) assistance, appoints a liaison as needed where two groups have strong dependencies; see the list of [W3C liaisons](https://www.w3.org/liaisons/). The Liaison's primary role is to facilitate resolution of the dependency between the two groups.

An overall question: is there always a "Group A" & "Group B," in other words a "home" group that is having its requirements considered in a "host" (or 'target'??) group, or is the liaisoning relationship sometimes completely mutual?


## Ensures adequate Dependency statement

- Is familiar with [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/) and the [W3C Guide](../).

- Reviews (hopefully) existing dependency statement, otherwise ensures that appropriate dependency statement is written.
- Contributes additional ideas to dependency statement as needed to update or make more accurate.

## Monitors discussion in both Groups

- Keeps current with discussion and document progress in both Groups? (?Should a liaison have to fulfill active membership requirements in both groups? could be prohibitive)
- Monitors status of technical issues related to areas of dependency.
- Maintains coordination with Chairs of both Groups.

## Keep each Group informed of the other's requirements & timelines


- Notifies either Group when dependency issues need discussion/negotiation.
- Explain, or ensures explanation of, technology or requirements of the other Group as needed (e.g., a tutorial, for instance of Group B's technology for Group A's requirements exploration).

## Ensure resolution of dependencies

- Ensures discussion and consensus in Group A on requirements to bring to Group B.
- Represents requirements of Group A to Group B.
- Assists in negotiating requirements of Group A with Group B *with assistance of Staff Contact, and Project Lead as needed.*
- Brings back follow-up items for discussion as needed...
