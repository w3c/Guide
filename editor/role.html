<p>
  The role of the editor is not that of author. They maintain the text of a current draft
  that the Group has agreed to and possibly to suggest concrete wording when none is
  forthcoming from the group.
</p>
<p>
  Specification editors are <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/chair/role.html">appointed
  by the Group Chair</a>.
</p>

<section>
<h2>Role of the editor</h2>

<p>The specification editor have all the responsibilities of the author
  but none of the rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Must maintain the draft on behalf of the Group, since the intellectual responsibility
    for the specification should remain with the Group</li>
  <li>Need to be willing to write into the draft whatever the group decides, even
    if they personally would prefer something else.</li>
</ul>

<p>In practice, a specification editor will tend to have some leeway in matters which
  the Group does not explicitly decide, and it would be a very unusual editor who is not
ipso facto an influential voice in Group deliberations. Editors need to practice egoless
writing and draftsmanship in much the same way that some programming disciplines
encourage egoless programming.</p>

<section>
<h2>Workmode</h2>

<p>
There are at least two ways to deal with the initial creation of a
working draft for a spec or other document, which may be worth
distinguishing.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Text follows design decisions</dt>
<dd>
<p>This approachs requires (or at least expects) that design
decisions will be made *before* drafting the relevant sections of a
spec.</p>
<p>It places more emphasis on design discussions *before* drafting, and
requires more editorial deference to the Group.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Text precedes design decisions</dt>
<dd>
<p>
 This approach regards design decisions as best made in the form of
revision, replacement, or approval of some existing text, and thus
requires (or at least expects) that a draft text will be created
*before* design decisions are made.
</p>
<p>It places more responsibility
and power in the editors' hands and insists less on editorial
deference.
</p>
<p>
A specification editor may have proposed text for the draft:
</p>
<ul>
<li>in a separate space (such as a pull request) and incorporate the text
once a Group decision has been made;
</li>
<li>or, in the specification draft itself and request Group decision to validate
it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that once a draft is complete, the two approaches tend to
converge, though views may differ over whether it's essential, or only
desirable, to provide specific replacement wording for any proposed
change to a draft, before the proposed change is discussed.</p>
