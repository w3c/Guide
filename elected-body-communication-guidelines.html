<p>This document provides guidance for members of W3C elected bodies like the Advisory Board (AB) and Technical Architecture Group (TAG).</p>

<h2 id="intro">W3C elected bodies</h2>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB">AB</a> and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#TAG">TAG</a> are defined in the W3C Process, as are the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#AB-TAG-participation">rules of participation</a> for both groups.</p>

<h2 id="values">W3C values and behaviours</h2>

<p>Like all W3C participants, members of elected bodies are required to follow the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a> (CEPC). As leaders, members of elected bodies should also consider the ways in which they can demonstrate the CEPC's <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#expected-behavior">expected behavior</a>, and proactively respond to instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/#unacceptablebehavior">unacceptable behavior</a>.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines">Communication guidelines</h2>

<p>As the W3C process says:</p>

<blockquote>Advisory Board and TAG participants have a special role within W3C. They are elected by the membership and appointed by the Director with the expectation that they will use their best judgement to find the best solutions for the web, not just for any network, technology, vendor, or user.</blockquote>

<p>As leaders within the W3C community, the opinions of members of elected bodies carry particular weight, whether they are expressed within our community or elsewhere.</p>

<p>As a member of an elected body:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is assumed you are speaking as an individual unless you state otherwise.</li>
<li>If you want to express the opinion of your organisation or a group you are affiliated with, make it clear before you state their view.</li>
<li>If you have multiple roles within the W3C community, for example you are a member of the AB and also a member of the Advisory Committee (AC), but your position as AB member is not the same as your position as AC representative, inform the other members of the group as a courtesy.</li>
<li>Do not use phrases like "on behalf of the AB" or "the TAG thinks that" unless the group has asked you to do so.</li>
<li>When you represent the elected body you are a member of, be clear that is what you are doing.</li>
<li>When not speaking for the elected body you are a member of, be aware that people will still be aware of your participation. You may decide to mention your participation anyway and should do so cautiously. Here are some examples:
<ul>
<li>If you are making a comment which has nothing to do with the business of the elected body you are a member of, there is no need to mention your participation.</li>
<li>If your comment is influenced by your participation in the elected body, you may want to mention it, for example "In my experience of being on the AB...".</li>
<li>You will be held to a higher standard as a result of your elected status and in recognition of your leadership within the W3C community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="decisions">Representing formal decisions</h2>

<p>When communicating a formal decision by the elected body you are a member of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Express clearly what was decided and what was not decided.</li>
<li>Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of, with time for them to review and comment on the message before it is released.</li>
<li>If time is limited because the elected body needs to respond urgently, a minimum review period of 24 hours plus review by the Chair(s) of the elected body is required.</li>
</ul>

<p>When discussing a decision made by the elected body you are a member of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be respectful about the decision, even if you did not support the consensus of the elected body.</li>
<li>Be respectful of all points of view, even those that did not gain consensus.</li>
</ul>

<p>When discussing a matter that has not reached a conclusion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be clear that the discussion is ongoing and has not reached a conclusion.</li>
<li>Make it clear when feedback and comments are wanted, and let people know how to do so.</li>
<li>Share the intended message with the rest of the elected body you are a member of before you send it.</li>
</ul>
