      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This document is intended to help Working Groups in deciding whether to
        maintain a document using revised Candidate Recommendations or revised Recommendations.
      </p>
      <h2 id="process">W3C Process</h3>
      <p>The W3C Process offers two ways to maintain a document on the Recommendation track:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#revising-cr">Revising a Candidate Recommendation</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Candidate Recommendation Snapshots get similar patent commitments to W3C Recommendations but do not get
          endorsed by W3C as standards for the Web. The document can be revised rapidly by publishing Candidate
          Recommendation Drafts on a daily basis.
        </dd>
        <dt><a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#revising-rec">Recommendations</a></dt>
        <dd>
          Recommendations are endorsed by W3C as standards for the Web. The document can be revised rapidly by publishing candidate
          corrections/additions on a daily basis.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2 id="cr">When should a Group keep a document as a Candidate Recommendation?</h2>

        <p>
          A document is not ready to advance to Recommendation if one or more of the conditions apply:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Unresolved issues prevent any useful subset of the document moving forward</li>
          <li>Insufficient test coverage to demonstrate adequate implementation experience</li>
          <li>Inadequate implementation experience</li>
        </ol>

        <p>If technical issues remain unresolved for a long time,
          solutions, the Working Group should consider moving the document to the <a href='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#abandon-draft'>Discontinued Draft</a> status.</p>

        <h2 id="cr">When should a Group move to Recommendation?</h2>
        <p>
          As soon as it is ready. Unless one or more of the 3 conditions to remain in Candidate Recommendation are valid, a Working Group is strongly
          encouraged to move forward to Recommendation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting to Recommendation is the only way to receive the full endorsement from the W3C for a technical specification.
          <strong>Candidate Recommendations are not endorsed by W3C.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2 id="rec">When should a Group keep a document as a Recommendation?</h2>

        <p>
          A document remains in Recommendation if one or more of the conditions apply:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A meaningful/core subset of the document can be normative and received adequate implementation experience</li>
          <li>Future corrections and improvements can be dealt through a revision of the Recommendation, including for new features</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note: A Working Group should not move a specification to Proposed Recommendation without considering how to maintain/revise the future Recommendation.</p>

        <h3 id="rec_cons">Ensuring the future of your Recommendation</h3>
        <p>
          Here are considerations to allow a Recommendation to be revised:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Editorial updates can be made at any time on a Recommendation, without further review</li>
          <li>Candidate corrections to make substantive changes can be made at any time on a Recommendation, without further review. Those candidate corrections are not considered normative.</li>
          <li>Proposed corrections to make substantive changes can be made at any time on a Recommendation, but do trigger reviews.  Those proposed corrections are not considered normative.</li>
          <li>Similarly, if allowed by the Proposed Recommendation, candidate and proposed additions to add new features can be made at any time on a Recommendation</li>
          <li>Once proper reviews are done, proposed corrections and proposed additions can be made normative.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="rec">When should a Group move a Recommendation back to Working Draft or Candidate Recommendation?</h2>

        <p>
          A document should be moved back to Working Draft or Candidate Recommendation if one or more of the conditions apply:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The document was improperly moved to Recommendation</li>
        </ol>
