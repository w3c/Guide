<p>Charters are <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/Process-20200915/#WGCharterDevelopment">formally</a> developed by the Team, with community input.
	In practice, ideas for new charter development come from a range of sources: Community Groups, Interest Groups, Workshops, input to the Strategy Incubation Pipeline.
	Team documents proposals in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2">Strategy Team's Incubation Pipeline (Funnel)</a>,
	and moves them through the pipeline (left to right) as they progress.</p>

<p>In particular, Community Groups and Interest Groups may develop draft charters (or draft the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html#scope">"scope"</a> and <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html#deliverables">"deliverables"</a> section of a charter)
	when they identify work items that they believe are ready for the Recommendation track.</p>

<p>The Strategy Team identifies a charter shephered, through the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/main/4.Chartering.md">process documented in the "chartering" column</a> of the public Pipeline.
	Each area of exploration or possible new work is shown as a GitHub issue.
	Interested community members are invited to add comments to the issue thread with information or expressions of support or concern, and to share pull requests on draft charters.</p>

		<p>For both new charters and recharters, please <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/new/choose">create an issue</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues">Strategy Repo</a> and add
	a card for the issue to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2">Incubation Pipeline</a> as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>Keep the Project Management Lead (for existing groups) and/or the Strategy Lead (for new groups) in the loop.</p>

  <p id="'TiLT">TiLT, the <a href='../teamcontact/tilt.html'>W3C Technical issues Lead Team</a>, is in charge of
    the technical decisions described in the W3C Process,
    decided or determined by the Team (<a
    href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/Drafts/#decision-types">Types
    of Decisions</a>).</p>

<p>For existing groups, the Chair and Team Contact should work with
the WG to create a new charter and develop rationale as to why the
change is necessary. This reason need not be overly formal. For
instance, it may be no more complex than, "we need three more
months to complete our deliverable commitments and are fairly
certain we can complete them within those three months." If the
Working Group or the Chair proposes changes to the charter, they
should send them to the Team Contact, who should see that the
request is reviewed by the Project and Strategy Leads in a timely manner.</p>

<p>Team Contacts and others proposing charters should start from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/">Charter Template</a>, rather than copying
	an existing Group charter, as the template reflects the latest guidance from Membership and the Director/TiLT on common matters of structure.</p>


<!--<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> For existing groups, this takes no time. For new groups, it may take one month or more for W3M
  to start dedicating resources.</p> -->

<h2 id="advance">1. New Groups: Advance Notice</h2>

<!-- Resolved at W3M 11 July 2007 -->

<p><a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharterDevelopment">W3C Process</a> requires Team notify the Advisory Committee when a
charter for a <strong>new</strong> Working Group or Interest Group is
in development. The exact timing of the advance notice may vary from
charter to charter. In practice, if the advance notice would precede
the formal call for review by only a short delay, we skip the advance
notice.</p>

<p>The Team should consult <a href="adv-notice.html">How to
Send Advance Notice of Work to the Advisory Committee</a> for more
information and a template announcement.</p>

	<h2 id="minor">2. Existing Groups: Minor Changes and Extensions</h2>

	<p>The Chair(s) and Group may make requests for minor changes and extension via their Team Contacts(s), who will forward the requests to the Project and Strategy Leads.  Include a justification, which might be as simple as "we need three more months to complete our deliverable commitments and are fairly certain we can complete them within those three months."</p>

<h2>3. <a id="creation" name="creation">Charter Creation</a></h2>

<p>TL;DR: use the current <a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html">Charter template</a> for both new charters and recharters - it will prompt for the inclusion of Patent Policy language and otherwise help you meet the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">list of charter requirements in the Process</a>.</p>

<p> For existing groups, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/css/deliverables">charter assistant</a> helps in producing the list of exclusion drafts. Use the proper shortname in the URL.</p>

  <p>The Team Contact or shepherd works with the Strategy Team and interested community participants to
draft a provisional charter. See the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html">Charter template</a>
and
W3C Process Document for the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">list of charter requirements</a>.
The Team Contact may wish to share drafts of the provisional
charter with relevant interest groups and interested community of W3C members prior to Advisory Committee
review.</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> due to the discussion needing to happen with the community and the need
  for horizontal review, this takes 1.5 to 4 months for existing groups.</p>

<h3 id="horizontal-review">3.1 Horizontal Review</h3>

	<p>Once there is agreement on a draft charter, ideally among Team Contact(s), candidate chairs(s), relevant interest groups, and interested community members, seek review from the Strategy Team and horizontal reviewers by:
	<ol><li>Opening a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Evaluation%3A+untriaged&template=04-Chartering.md&title=">Chartering issue</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues">Strategy Repo</a>,</li>
	<li>Adding a card for the issue to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2">Incubation Pipeline</a>,</li>
	<li>Adding the <a class="IssueLabel-big" style="background: #9ae504;" href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues">Horizontal review requested</a>
	label to the issue, and</li>
	<li>Optionally, announce the new charter-in-progress to team-strategy and/or on a Strategy Team call.</li>
	</ol></p>

<p>Horizontal reviewers will usually respond within two weeks, though it is wise to allow for additional time.
</p>

<p>If you need to reach the horizontal reviewers as a group, use the team-horizontal list.</p>

<p>When the Charter is brought to TiLT, the Team Contact should note the horizontal review status in the Pipeline.
If team was unable to obtain timely review, then the Team
Contact can move ahead with the charter nevertheless, and should
report this to TiLT. </p>

<h2>4. <a id="approval" name="approval">Charter Approval by
TiLT</a></h2>

<p>TiLT approval of a charter is <strong>required</strong> unless there are <strong>no substantive changes</strong> from a previously approved charter.</p>

<p>The TiLT process for approving new Charters is described in the
(Team-only) documentation on <a href="https://www.w3.org/Project/Brief/CharterApproval.html#bp-review">TiLT evaluation of Proposed Charter and AC Reviews</a>.
The Strategy or Project Lead (or delegate) informs the W3C Communications Team of TiLT approval
by sending email to <a
href="mailto:w3t-comm@w3.org">w3t-comm@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p class="timeline"><em>Timeline:</em> this takes 2 weeks.</p>

  <h3 id="extension">Charter Extension and Update</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Is the Group aware that its charter is being extended? Please inform the group before discussion within TiLT.</p>

<p>W3C resolved to adopt the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/04/charter-extensions.html">Policy on W3C Group Charter End Dates</a>, effective 18 June 2015.</p>

<p>W3M amended the policy on 17 November 2021: charter extension can only be up to 6 months beyond the end date of the current charter. Any request for more than 6 months
  MUST treated as <a href='#creation'>rechartering</a>.</p>

<p>TiLT keeps following those resolutions.</p>

<p>If TiLT resolves to extend a charter, the Strategy or Project Lead (or delegate) sends e-mail to the
W3C Communications Team in the form of an extension announcement; see the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2Ftemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcharter-extension.html&amp;submit=Continue...">charter extension template</a>.</p>

	<p>The W3C Communications Team:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sends extension announcements to w3c-ac-members@w3.org</li>
		<li>... and later forwards the announcements as FYI to chairs@w3.org</li>
		<li>It is a good practice to forward the extension announcement to the public list of the group, and to follow-up on public-new-work.</li>
		<li>updates the <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a> accordingly.</li>
	</ul>

<h4>Updating the Charter</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>When a charter is <strong>extended</strong>, the Team Contact (or W3C Communications Team) modifies the Charter in place as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>The "End Date" in the table at the top is modified in place.</li>
<li>Any update to the Chair(s) (e.g., a Chair resigns or is (re)appointed), Team Contact(s) (e.g., names, FTEs), etc.</li>
<li>The changes including extension history are documented in the "About this charter" section at the bottom and lists each extension dates and the pairs of from/until dates. (Note: If the group is developing a new charter, link to the GitHub repo of where the new charter is being developed).</li>
<li>The text "Note: The group will document significant changes from this initial schedule on the group home page." is updated with a link to the group's updated milestones
(e.g., on the group's site) to say something like "Note: See changes from this initial schedule on the group home page."</li>
</ul>
	<li>When a group <strong>Chair</strong> is (re)appointed or resigns, shortly before/after the announcement to w3c-ac-members@w3.org [then forwarded to chairs@w3.org] (sample emails [<a href="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Member/search?keywords=&hdr-1-name=subject&hdr-1-query=appointed&index-grp=Member__FULL+Public__FULL&index-type=t&type-index=w3c-ac-members">1</a>][<a href="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Member/search?keywords=&hdr-1-name=subject&hdr-1-query=steps+down&index-grp=Member__FULL+Public__FULL&index-type=t&type-index=w3c-ac-members">2</a>]), Team Contact (or W3C Communications Team) modifies the charter, including:
	<ul>
	<li>Update the "Chair" in the table at the top.</li>
	<li>Document changes in "About this charter" section at the bottom.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>When there's <strong>editorial change</strong> to the charter, in which case no announcement to w3c-ac-members@w3.org or chairs@w3.org is required, Team Contact modifies the charter timely, e.g., fix editorial errors (broken links, typos, etc.).</li>
	</ul>

<h2>5. <a id="cfr" name="cfr">Advisory Committee Review of the
Charter</a></h2>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section 5.2.3
of the W3C Process</a>, The Director must solicit Advisory Committee review of every new or substantively modified Working Group or Interest Group charter.
The Director is not required to solicit Advisory Committee review prior to a charter extension or for minor changes. The review period must be at least 28 days.
Any Advisory Committee representative may request an extended review period of any new or substantively modified Working Group charter, if submitted with a Member’s comments in response to the Call for Review (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2Ftemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcharter-extension.html&amp;submit=Continue...">extension template</a>). Upon receipt of
any such request, the Director must ensure that the Call for Participation for the Working Group occurs at least 60 days after the Call for Review of the charter.
</p>

<p class="timeline"><em>Timeline:</em> this takes 5 weeks minimum. Formal objections to a charter will
  add more time.</p>

<h3>5.1 Organizing the Call for Review</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Contacts should ensure that their
Working Group participants are aware of the review.</p>

<p>The Team Contact:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reuses an existing Team-only mailing list (e.g. <a href="mailto:w3t-archive@w3.org">w3t-archive@w3.org</a>) for the Advisory Committee review (or <a href="/Systems/Mail/Request/">creates a new Team-only mailing list</a>.)
    <ul>
      <li>If new, the mailing list should be named team-xxx-review@w3.org
	(in accordance with the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/Systems/Mail/Request/#doc-listname">list name policy</a>).
      </li>
      <li>The mailing list must be Team-only.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must be archived.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must have at least one subscriber to monitor
	mail: the Team Contact.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must accept posts from the
	address <a href="mailto:sysbot+wbs@w3.org">sysbot+wbs@w3.org</a> to
	receive questionnaire responses. After the list is created, use
	the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/admin/manage">list administration tool</a> to add
	this address to the accept2 file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sends a request to the W3C Communications Team (<a href="mailto:w3t-comm@w3.org">w3t-comm@w3.org</a>)
    asking that a Call for Review be sent to the AC. The request should
    be sent <strong>at least three business days before</strong> the anticipated start
    date of the review. The request must include:
    <ol>
      <li>A URI to the proposed charter (Note: avoid using github.io links); this charter is public during the AC review.</li>
      <li>The list of significant changes to a revised charter
	(per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section "Advisory Committee Review of a Working Group or Interest Group Charter"</a> of the Process Document). It is useful to include a diff between the current and proposed charters (You may wish to use the <a
            href="https://services.w3.org/htmldiff">HTML diff tool</a>).</li>
	<li>In case of renewal of an existing charter, whether the group scope has changed. E.g., are there any new deliverables with licensing obligations under the W3C Patent Policy? The current group participants would need to re-join the group once the revised charter is approved.</li>
      <li>A recommended review start date and duration (at least 28 days according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">the process document</a>)</li>
      <li>A URI to the review of the proposed charter in the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues">Strategy GitHub repository</a></li>
      <li>The name of the Team-only mailing list for comments</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The W3C Communications Team encourages the Team Contact to include in
the request a draft Call for Review, created by using this
<a
href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcfr.html&amp;submit=Continue...">
template</a> (although the URI to the questionnaire may not yet
exist).</p>

<p>The W3C Communications Team (or the motivated Team Contact) builds a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/apCFRFactory">Call for
Review questionnaire</a>. The URI for the questionnaire is added to
the Call for Review announcement to members. In case of renewal of an existing charter, it is also useful to include a diff (You may wish to use the <a href="https://services.w3.org/htmldiff">HTML diff tool</a>) between current and proposed charters in the Call for Review questionnaire.
<!--
<strong>Note:</strong>
The questionnaire builder
produces questionnaires for groups under the W3C Patent Policy. Here
is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/EOWG03/">sample of
an old-style questionnaire</a> for a group under the CPP; the claims
and licensing sections are relevant and should replace the W3C Patent
Policy section of the newer questionnaires.
-->
</p>

<p>Once the Head of W3C Communications (or explicit delegate) has approved the Call for Review and the questionnaire, the W3C
Communications Team:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sends the Call for Review to w3c-ac-members@w3.org.</li>
  <li>Sends a version of the announcement to public-new-work@w3.org
    (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">archive</a>).
    Use this <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fpublic-charter.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template</a> (and see the
    <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2007Jan/0001.html">example</a>). The announcement must include:
    <ul>
      <li>The URI of the (public) charter.</li>
      <li>The end date of the Member review.</li>
      <li>That W3C invites public feedback on public-new-work@w3.org
	(<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">archive</a>).
      </li>
      <li>That we make no guarantees of replying to feedback. </li>
      <li>That people who work for a Member organization should
	coordinate their comments through their Advisory Committee Representative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send the same email <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/new-work">new-work@ietf.org</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> public-new-work@w3.org used to cc new-work@ietf.org but due to mailing list configuration issues, we stopped that practice.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in January 2007, W3C makes
all charters public <em>during</em> Advisory Committee review.</p>

<h3>5.2 <a id="review-eval" name="review-eval">Evaluating the
Review Results</a></h3>

<p>TiLT evaluation of the review results proceeds the same way as <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Project/Brief/CharterApproval.html#review-eval">TiLT evaluation of
Review Results</a>.</p>

<p>Beginning in July 2014, the Director <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2014JulSep/0018.html">instituted an experimental
practice when it comes to approving Working Group Charters</a>.</p>

<p>
Generally, the Director will expect to receive reviews for Charter proposals
from at least 5% of the Membership. If this 5% threshold is not met, the
Charter may still be approved, but additional scrutiny is warranted, and
resource allocation may be limited. Additionally, the Director will continue to consider
the number of declarations of intent to participate or implement the
output of the Working Group.</p>

<p>Given the diversity of work underway in the Consortium, including
groups that focus on horizontal reviews (e.g. accessibility, security,
and internationalization), as well as technologies that are initially
focused on by some segment of the Web's stakeholders, there are times
where exceptions to this practice may be warranted. In those cases,
the Director will document reasons why the exception is warranted.</p>

<h3 id="managing-changes">5.3 Managing Changes to Charters</h3>

<p>Very minor changes may be made in place to a charter. If there are only very minor changes to a charter resulting from the review, the (future) Director's decision includes the original charter URI and an explanation of the changes and their rationale.</p>
<p>If substantive changes are proposed in response to charter review, Team must send the charter with proposed changes, the <a
            href="https://services.w3.org/htmldiff">HTML
            diff</a>, and an explanation of the changes and their rationale to all who reviewed the charter, copying the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/member-charters-review/">member-charters-review@w3.org</a> member-archived mailing list, accompanied by a request for response (with a deadline of a minimum one week response time) if reviewers have concerns or if the changes would alter their reviews. If the work continues or derives from an existing Group or community effort, Team should also send the <a
            href="https://services.w3.org/htmldiff">HTML
            diff</a> and a public rationale to that Group or community. These communications should note that the Director has not yet approved the charter.</p>
	<blockquote>Suggested wording: Please let us know by [date+1 week] if you have concerns or if this change would alter your review.</blockquote>
<p>If anyone expresses new concern in response to the re-review, Team may attempt to resolve the concern (with re-review), formally open a new AC charter review, or the Director may treat it as an objection and overrule it.</p>

<p>If there are substantive changes, before any announcement, the team:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mints a new URI for the version of the charter that includes the changes. In the "Charter History" section of the charter, please link to the original (reviewed) charter.</li>
<li>Modifies the original charter in place with the
following status sentence at the top:
<blockquote>
&lt;p class="todo"&gt;This charter has been replaced
      by &lt;a&gt;[a newer version]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. <a id="director-decision" name="director-decision">
Announcement of Director's Decision, Call for Participation</a></h2>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section 5.2.3 of the W3C Process</a>, any Advisory Committee representative may request an extended review period of any new or substantively modified Working Group charter, if submitted with a Member’s comments in response to the Call for Review. Upon receipt of any such request, the Director must ensure that the Call for Participation for the Working Group occurs at least 60 days after the Call for Review of the charter.</p>

<p>Please ensure that the following are done and you have documentation before requesting to announce a group:</p>

<ol>
<li>TiLT has approved the group, whether or not preceded by an Advisory Committee Review</li>
<li>The group exists in the Groups DB.
<ul>
  <li>If the group does not exist.<br>
  Contact the W3C Communications Team to <a href="/admin/dashboard">create the group</a> by sending a mail to <a href="mailto:w3t-comm@w3.org">w3t-comm@w3.org</a>. Note that this requires:
    <ul>
      <li>group name</li>
      <li>group shortname</li>
      <li>charter URI</li>
      <li>homepage URI <em>(only if you want to use a page different that the automatically generated <a href="/groups/">group pages</a>)</em></li>
    </ul>
    Creating the group will lists the group in the drop-down for db-backed groups in the mailing list creation form.
  </li>
  <li>If the group already exists
    <ul>
      <li>For WGs and IGs that are more than mailing lists.<br>
      Simply reuse the existing join form; all join pages are available from the <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a>.</li>
      <li>If the group is an IG that is just a mailing list.<br>
      Document on the group's home page that to join the group people subscribe to the list.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>All relevant mailing lists exist. If not, Team Contact may <a href="/Systems/Mail/Request/">create the mailing list(s)</a>.</li>
<li>The main mailing list is associated with the group via the <a href="/2011/04/dbwg/group-services">Group Service Management</a> interface.</li>
 <li>Make sure the charter is public (since 2007, charters are public during AC review) and any final edits (e.g., addition of link to page for joining the group) have been made.</li>
	<li>Customize the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/onboarding">"onboarding" message</a> that will be sent to participants as they join the group.</li>
	</ol>

<p>
    All Working Groups and Interest Groups appear in their respective <a href="/groups/">group list</a> and have a
    public list of participants (except for Interest Groups that are not managed by IPP).
</p>

<p>The W3C Communications Team should try to minimize the number of
messages sent to the Advisory Committee, while ensuring that each
message is clear. In general, the W3C Communications Team sends one email combining the group approval (Director's Decision) and the call for participation.</p>

<p class="timeline"><em>Timeline:</em> this takes a week at most.</p>

<h3>6.1 Organizing the Director's Decision, Call for Participation</h3>

<p>The Team contact sends a draft announcement (combing Director's Decision and Call for Participation) to the W3C Communications Team (<a href="mailto:w3t-comm@w3.org">w3t-comm@w3.org</a>) (using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcfp.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template</a> as a starting point, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Member/search?keywords=&amp;hdr-1-name=subject&amp;hdr-1-query=call+for+participation&amp;index-grp=Member__FULL+Public__FULL&amp;index-type=t&amp;type-index=w3c-ac-members">sample announcement</a>). The announcement must indicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whether the group is approved and its charter end date.</li>
<li>The URI of the final charter.</li>
<li>Any substantive changes from the charter that was reviewed (In case of charter renewal, it is useful to include a <a href="https://services.w3.org/htmldiff">HTML diff</a> between the approved and previous charters).</li>
  <li>A link to the group public home page.</li>
  <li>A link to a page with information about the mechanism used to join the group (e.g., a URI to an IPP "join" form for a group under the W3C Patent Policy).</li>
  <li>Name and contact information for the Team Contact(s)</li>
  <li>AC review results of the proposed charter</li>
  <li>Rationale for approving the group despite objections in case of objections to the charter under review</li>
</ul>

<p>It is useful to include notice of the 45 day timeframe in case when existing participants of the Group under the previous charter need to re-join the group because a charter has new deliverables in-scope.</p>

<p>In order to avoid confusion, it's also useful to state that existing participants under the previous charter are not required to leave/re-join the group, when the new charter doesn't have new deliverables involving new patent commitment.</p>

<p>Note: Per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/01/13-w3m-minutes#t08">2021-01-13 W3M resolution</a> (team-only), the calls for participation should include guidance to consider diversity (available from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcfp.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Please consider diversity when proposing people to participate in W3C groups. Representation from a wider group of people, especially people from under-represented groups, is vital for creating web standards that meet the needs of the wider web community.</li>
</ul>

<p>The announcement must also indicate when appropriate:</p>

<ul>
  <li>For a newly created group, information about the dates of the first face-to-face meeting.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Head of W3C Communications (or explicit delegate) must approve the Director's Decision and Call for Participation before the W3C Communications Team sends it to <a href="mailto:w3c-ac-members@w3.org">w3c-ac-members@w3.org</a>. The W3C Communications Team SHOULD announce the Director's decision within <span class="time-interval">two weeks</span> after the end of the AC review (or send an email setting new expectations). An announcement is
made if the proposal is approved <em>or</em> rejected.</p>

<p><strong>If the group is <em>approved</em></strong>, it is a good
practice that the W3C Communications Team also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>forwards the Call for Participation to the Working Group's
primarily public mailing list (to notify the group, including Invited
Experts). The Results of the Call for Review and any member-only
information should be
elided. See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webassembly/2017Aug/0001.html">example</a>.</li>
  <li>follows-up on the Advance Notice in public-new-work with a
  pointer to that
  announcement. See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Aug/0001.html">example</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the group is <em>rejected</em></strong>, it is a good
practice that the W3C Communications Team follows-up on the Advance
Notice in public-new-work to close the loop for the public record.</p>

<h3><a name="join-form">6.2 After sending the Director's Decision, Call for Participation</a></h3>

<p>After sending the Director's Decision and Call for Participation:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that IPP has the latest charter link (the W3C Communications Team <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">searches</a> the group and edits information to add a new charter)
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Team/w3t-comm/2021Jul/0084.html">2021-07-12 Update</a>: associate with a charter the 'W3C document license', the 'W3C software and document license' or both. The document licenses to be selected can be found in the section ‘Licensing’ of
the charter itself. (Rationale: we need to record that bit in the charter admin interface in order to expose it in our API, in order to check that a document produced by a WG/IG is using the right document license.)</li>
		<li>2022-07-19 Update: For recharters, deactivate the previous charter when a new charter is valid:
			<ol>
			<li>add a note to the previous charter indicating "This charter has been replaced by &lt;a&gt;[a newer version]&lt/a&gt";</li>
			<li>if the previous charter hasn't expired when a new charter is installed, deactivate the previous charter by changing its end date via <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">the charter admin interface</a>.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
<li>If the group is using IPP as the join mechanism,
the W3C Communications Team uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">Groups DB</a> interface to
record that a Call for Participation was sent (so that all links via the Groups DB, including the charter one on the IPP join form, are actually live).</li>
<li>If the group was "staged", W3C Communications Team unstages it.</li>
<li>The public <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a> is automatically updated from the Groups DB, including a 1-paragraph description.</li>
<li>Team Contact marks the chair(s) as such in the Group's admin view (this automatically adds the chair(s) to the
<a href="/admin/othergroups/31972/show">Chairs' group</a>).</li>
<li>Function Lead or Team Contact(s) update the Team's <a href="/2005/09/manage/">effort tables</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When we recharter a Working Group and the charter scope has changed, we enter the CFP into the Group DB, which triggers messages to the group participants that they must rejoin. If the new charter is not substantively different, do not register the new CFP.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Contacts with questions about how an
Invited Expert joins a group should consult the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/invited_expert">Team Policy for
Invited Experts</a>.</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline for Charter creation</h2>

<p>Depending on the complexity of the charter, the time to draft and get a charter approved by the W3C Director may vary greatly.
  Each section above gives expectation on how long it takes. This section gives guidance on how to manage the overall timeline.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>You should be planning for 4 months to get a charter approved for a group, if starting from nothing.
    More may be needed if the scope or deliverables are controversial.
  </li>
  <li>Some of the steps can be done in parallel.
    <ul>
      <li>Request the advance notice from the Strategy Lead as soon as you have something to point to.</li>
      <li>Start the horizontal reviews of the charter as soon as the scope, deliverables, and dependencies
         parts of the charter are stable enough. Ping the horizontal reviewers on a weekly basis.</li>
      <li>Start working on resolving any formal objection on a charter as soon as those received. Don't wait
        for the end of the AC review period.
      </li>
      <li>Prepare a draft of your proposed Director approval announcement before getting the approval from TiLT</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to have the Project Management Lead (for existing groups) and/or the Strategy Lead in the
    loop.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="cfe">7.4 Organizing a Call for Exclusions</a></h3>

<p>The W3C Communications Team sends out a Call for Exclusion either
   at the same time as a CFP (for a group making the transition) or
   approximately ninety days after the FPWD of a specification with
   associated licensing obligations (for a group already under the
   policy). IPP reminds the W3C Communications Team automatically when to send a
   CFE (in both the transition and non-transition case) and includes
   a draft CFE in the reminder. Per <a
   href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-exclude-mech">section
   4.5 of the Patent Policy</a>, the W3C Communications Team sends
    the announcement to "the Working
   Group mailing list and the Advisory Committee Representatives of
   all organizations participating in the Working Group." The list of
   email addresses of AC Reps of participating Members is available at
   the bottom of the DBWG page for the group; see the <a
   href="https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/groups">list of
   groups</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Patent Policy states, "In the event that a
 Working Group issues more than one Recommendation-track document, the
 exclusion procedure will be employed for each series of documents
 individually."</p>
