</ul>
</div>

<p>First, W3M chooses a Team Contact to manage the group creation
process.</p>

<p>The Process Document includes a section on <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharterDevelopment">Working Group
and Interest Group Charter Development</a>, which includes a
requirement to alert the Advisory Committee when work begins on a
charter for a new group. See also <a href="/2002/05/rec-tips">tips for
getting to Recommendation faster</a> and <a
href="/TR/qa-handbook/">The QA Handbook</a>, which discusses process
and operational aspects of certain quality assurance practices of
W3C's Working Groups,</p>

<p>For existing groups, the Chair and Team Contact should work with
the WG to create a new charter and develop rationale as to why the
change is necessary. This reason need not be overly formal. For
instance, it may be no more complex than, "we need three more
months to complete our deliverable commitments and are fairly
certain we can complete them within those three months." If the
Working Group or the Chair proposes changes to the charter, they
should send them to the Team Contact, who should see that the
request is reviewed by the Project and Strategy Leads in a timely manner.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Contacts should take caution when
creating a new charter by copying an old one, especially in light of
adoption of the W3C Patent Policy. Please review the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">list
of charter requirements</a> to ensure that your charter is complete
(e.g., it includes a duration for the group).</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> For existing groups, this takes no time. For new groups, it may take one month or more for W3M
  to start dedicating resources.</p>

<h2 id="advance">2. Advance Notice</h2>

<!-- Resolved at W3M 11 July 2007 -->

<p>W3C Process (<a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharterDevelopment">section
"Working Group and Interest Group Charter Development"</a>) requires that the Team notify the Advisory Committee when a
charter for a <strong>new</strong> Working Group or Interest Group is
in development. The exact timing of the advance notice may vary from
charter to charter. In practice, if the advance notice would precede
the formal call for review by only a short delay, we skip the advance
notice; see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2F&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fadv-charter.html&amp;submit=Continue...">Advance Notice for Charter template</a></p>

<p>The Team should consult <a href="/2005/09/adv-notice.html">How to
Send Advance Notice of Work to the Advisory Committee</a> for more
information.</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> This takes a week at most.</p>

<h2>3. <a id="creation" name="creation">Charter Creation</a></h2>

<p>The Team Contact works with the Strategy Lead to
draft a provisional charter. See the
<a href="https://w3c.github.io/charter-drafts/charter-template.html">Charter template</a>
and
W3C Process Document for the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">list of charter requirements</a>.
The Team Contact may wish to share drafts of the provisional
charter with a candidate Chair (if one exists), a relevant interest
group or interested community of W3C members prior to Member
review.</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> due to the discussion needing to happen with the community and the need
  for horizontal review, this takes 1.5 to 4 months for existing groups.</p>

<h3>3.1 Patent Policy Section for a Working Group Charter</h3>

<p>Each Working Group charter must include a section related
to the Patent Policy.</p>

<p>If a Working Group is chartered to produce Recommendations covered
by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C
Patent Policy</a>, the section title must be "Patent Policy"
and the section must include the following boilerplate text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This Working Group operates under the &lt;a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/"&gt;W3C
Patent Policy&lt;/a&gt; (Version of 15 September 2020). To promote the
widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue
Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy,
on a Royalty-Free basis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Add the following Note when applicable:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: All of the deliverables of this Working Group
are informative-only. Per section 8.3 of the W3C Patent Policy,
since no provisions in these deliverables constitute "architectural
[or] interoperability requirements," participants in this Working
Group have no licensing obligations associated with any of these
chartered deliverables.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the list of of a Working Group's deliverables, the Charter
<strong>must</strong> clearly indicate which documents are expected to
become Recommendations with associated licensing obligations as
described by the W3C Patent Policy. <strong>Note:</strong> the W3C Process
provides a precise <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">list of requirements</a>
when listing deliverables on the Recommendation track.</p>

<p>If a Working Group is chartered under the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent
Policy</a> but is not chartered to produce Recommendations covered by
the policy, the section title must be "Patent Disclosures" and the
section must include the following boilerplate text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The [Name] Working Group provides an opportunity to share
perspectives on [Topic]. This Working Group is not chartered
to produce Recommendations  with associated licensing obligations as
described by the W3C Patent Policy. W3C reminds Working Group participants of
their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set
out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While this Working Group does not
produce Recommendation-track documents, when Working Group
participants review Recommendation-track specifications from other
Working Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>3.2 Patent Policy Section for an Interest Group Charter</h3>

<p>Each Interest Group charter must include a section related
to the Patent Policy. For all Interest Groups,
the section title must be "Patent Disclosures" and the
section must include the following boilerplate text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The [Name] Interest Group provides an opportunity to share
perspectives on [Topic]. W3C reminds Interest Group participants of
their obligation to comply with patent disclosure obligations as set
out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the Interest Group's proceedings are public, add the
following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please note that the proceedings of this Interest Group (mailing
list archives, minutes, etc.) are publicly visible.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="disclosure-page">3.3 Reference to a Disclosure Page</h3>

<p>Each Working Group must have a public page for tracking patent
disclosures and exclusions regarding specifications produced by the
Working Group. The disclosure mechanics must not appear in the
charter since they are likely to change over time (as we begin to
automate more of this process). The Charter MAY include a link to a
disclosure page or refer to the Working Group home page, which must
include a link to the disclosure page. For instance, adding to one
of the above patent disclosure paragraphs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For information about patent disclosures or exclusions regarding
specifications produced by this Working Group, please refer to the
Working Group home page.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See <a href="/2005/07/13-pubrules-disclosure">Guidelines
for Linking to Patent Policy Disclosure Pages</a> (notably
for information about
linking to <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">IPP</a>, the system for
management of groups under the patent policy).</p>

<h3 id="horizontal-review">3.4 Horizontal Review</h3>

<p>Identification of horizontal dependencies should follow guidance
under <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">Section 5.2.6, 8th bullet, of the W3C Process</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are key characteristics that are typically required (in
different measure, and per section <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#wide-review">6.2.3.1 Wide Review of the Process Document</a>) of all specifications and they are therefore called
“horizontal” characteristics.  As of today, the identified horizontal
characteristics are: accessibility, internationalization, mobility,
device independence, privacy, security, and technical architecture
principles. For each of these characteristics, W3M will designate
which team members have expertise to help all team contacts ensure the
characteristics are achieved.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the charter creation process, the Team Contact needs to
involve at least one expert for each horizontal characteristic to
ensure that the Charter adequately describes any dependencies it might
have relative to horizontal characteristics. To do so, the Team Contact opens
a <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/new/choose">Chartering issue</a> in the
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues">Strategy Repo</a>. Ideally, this should be done early in
Charter development to avoid undue delays. The Team Contact
adds the <a class='IssueLabel-big' style='background: #9ae504;' href='https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues?q=label:"Horizontal+review+requested"'>Horizontal review requested</a>
label to the issue to formally request review.
Team Contacts should negotiate the timing of reviews early in the chartering process.</p>

<p>W3M must ensure that there are sufficient experts on staff so that
it generally does not take more than two weeks to get a response,
although in most cases it is beneficial for the experts to have more
time to provide input.</p>

<p>Different Working Groups are chartered with different levels of
specificity: some groups are accompanied by a draft list of
requirements or a draft spec. However, it is not the purpose of the
chartering to review these drafts for horizontal
characteristics – ultimately that is achieved through the normal W3C
Process. So in all cases, the purpose here is to ensure that
dependencies are identified; but there is no thorough review of the
spec.</p>

<p>Some of the key groups where there could be dependencies include:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/"
    >WAI Accessible Platform Architectures (APA) Working Group</a> (for accessibility)</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/review-request">Internationalization Working Group</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/IG"
    >Security Interest Group</a> (for security)</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/Privacy/"
    >Privacy Interest Group</a> (for privacy)</li>
 <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/"
    >Technical Architecture Group</a> (for technical architecture
    principles)</li>
</ul>

<p>When the Charter is brought to W3M, the Team Contact should state
which horizontal experts approved that the dependencies were
appropriately documented based on the current understanding of the
work. If when the Team Contact engaged experts there were
insufficient experts available for timely review, then the Team
Contact can move ahead with the charter nevertheless, and should
report this to W3M. W3M will monitor whether particular horizontal
activities are insufficiently resourced, leading to regular delays on
charter reviews.</p>

<h2>4. <a id="approval" name="approval">Charter Approval by
W3M</a></h2>

<p>W3M approval of a charter is <strong>required</strong> unless there are <strong>no substantive changes</strong> from a previously approved charter.</p>

<p>The W3M process for approving new Charters is described in the
(Team-only) documentation on <a href="https://www.w3.org/Project/Brief/CharterApproval.html#bp-review">W3M evaluation of Proposed Charter and AC Reviews</a>.
The Strategy or Project Lead (or delegate) informs the Comm Team of W3M approval
by sending email to <a
href="mailto:w3t-comm@w3.org">w3t-comm@w3.org</a>, or the Head of Communications forwards the W3M action for information.</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> this takes 2 weeks.</p>

  <h3 id="extension">Charter Extension and Update</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Is the Group aware that its charter is being extended? Please inform the group before discussion within W3M.</p>

<p>W3M resolved to adopt the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/04/charter-extensions.html">Policy on W3C Group Charter End Dates</a>, effective 18 June 2015.</p>

<p>If W3M resolves to extend a charter, the Strategy or Project Lead (or delegate) sends e-mail to the
Comm Team in the form of an extension announcement; see the
<a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2Ftemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcharter-extension.html&amp;submit=Continue...">charter extension template</a>.</p>

<p>The Comm Team sends extension announcements to
w3c-ac-members@w3.org and cc's chairs@w3.org. It is a good practice to forward the extension announcement to the public list of the group, and to follow-up on public-new-work.</p>
<p>The Comm Team updates
the <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a> accordingly.</p>

<h4>Updating the Charter</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>When a charter is <strong>extended</strong>, the Team Contact (or Comm Team) modifies the Charter in place as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>The "End Date" in the table at the top is modified in place.</li>
<li>Any update to the Chair(s) (e.g., a Chair resigns or is (re)appointed), Staff Contact(s) (e.g., names, FTEs), etc.</li>
<li>The changes including extension history are documented in the "About this charter" section at the bottom and lists each extension dates and the pairs of from/until dates.</li>
<li>The text "Note: The group will document significant changes from this initial schedule on the group home page." is updated with a link to the group's updated milestones
(e.g., on the group's site) to say something like
"Note: See changes from this initial schedule on the group home page."</li>
</ul>
	<li>When a group <strong>Chair</strong> is (re)appointed or resigns, shortly before/after the announcements to w3c-ac-members@w3.org and cc's chairs@w3.org (sample emails [<a href="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Member/search?keywords=&hdr-1-name=subject&hdr-1-query=appointed&index-grp=Member__FULL+Public__FULL&index-type=t&type-index=w3c-ac-members">1</a>][<a href="https://www.w3.org/Search/Mail/Member/search?keywords=&hdr-1-name=subject&hdr-1-query=steps+down&index-grp=Member__FULL+Public__FULL&index-type=t&type-index=w3c-ac-members">2</a>]), Team Contact (or Comm Team) modifies the charter, including:
	<ul>
	<li>Update the "Chair" in the table at the top.</li>
	<li>Document changes in "About this charter" section at the bottom.</li>
	</ul>
	<li>When there's <strong>editorial change</strong> to the charter, in which case no announcement to w3c-ac-members@w3.org and cc's chairs@w3.org is required, Team Contact modifies the charter timely, e.g., fix editorial errors (broken links, typos, etc.).</li>
	</ul>

<h2>5. <a id="cfr" name="cfr">Advisory Committee Review of the
Charter</a></h2>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section 5.2.3
of the W3C Process</a>, The Director must solicit Advisory Committee review of every new or substantively modified Working Group or Interest Group charter.
The Director is not required to solicit Advisory Committee review prior to a charter extension or for minor changes. The review period must be at least 28 days.
Any Advisory Committee representative may request an extended review period of any new or substantively modified Working Group charter, if submitted with a Member’s comments in response to the Call for Review (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2Ftemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcharter-extension.html&amp;submit=Continue...">extension template</a>). Upon receipt of
any such request, the Director must ensure that the Call for Participation for the Working Group occurs at least 60 days after the Call for Review of the charter.
</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> this takes 5 weeks minimum. Formal objections to a charter will
  add more time.</p>

<h3>5.1 Organizing the Call for Review</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Contacts should ensure that their
Working Group participants are aware of the review.</p>

<p>The Team Contact:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Reuses an existing Team-only mailing list (e.g. <a href="mailto:w3t-archive@w3.org">w3t-archive@w3.org</a>) for the Advisory Committee review (or <a href="/Systems/Mail/Request/">creates a new Team-only mailing list</a>.)
    <ul>
      <li>If new, the mailing list should be named team-xxx-review@w3.org
	(in accordance with the
	<a href="https://www.w3.org/Systems/Mail/Request/#doc-listname">list name policy</a>).
      </li>
      <li>The mailing list must be Team-only.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must be archived.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must have at least one subscriber to monitor
	mail: the Team Contact.</li>
      <li>The mailing list must accept posts from the
	address <a href="mailto:sysbot+wbs@w3.org">sysbot+wbs@w3.org</a> to
	receive questionnaire responses. After the list is created, use
	the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/admin/manage">list administration tool</a> to add
	this address to the accept2 file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sends a request to the Communications Team (w3t-comm)
    asking that a Call for Review be sent to the AC. The request should
    be sent <strong>at least three business days before</strong> the anticipated start
    date of the review. The request must include:
    <ol>
      <li>A URI to the proposed charter; this charter is public during the AC review.</li>
      <li>The list of significant changes to a revised charter
	(per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section "Advisory Committee Review of a Working Group or Interest Group Charter"</a> of the Process Document). You may wish to use the <a href="http://services.w3.org/htmldiff">html diff tool</a></li>
	<li>In case of renewal of an existing charter, whether the group scope has changed. E.g., are there any new deliverables with licensing obligations under the W3C Patent Policy? The current group participants would need to re-join the group once the revised charter is approved.</li>
      <li>A recommended review start date and duration (at least 28 days according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">the process document</a>)</li>
      <li>The name of the Team-only mailing list for comments</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The Communications Team encourages the Team Contact to include in
the request a draft Call for Review, created by using this
<a
href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcfr.html&amp;submit=Continue...">
template</a> (although the URI to the questionnaire may not yet
exist).</p>

<p>The Communications Team (or the motivated Team Contact) builds a <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/apCFRFactory">Call for
Review questionnaire</a>. The URI for the questionnaire is added to
the Call for Review.
<!--
<strong>Note:</strong>
The questionnaire builder
produces questionnaires for groups under the W3C Patent Policy. Here
is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/EOWG03/">sample of
an old-style questionnaire</a> for a group under the CPP; the claims
and licensing sections are relevant and should replace the W3C Patent
Policy section of the newer questionnaires.
-->
</p>

<p>Once the Head of Communications has approved (or explicitly
delegated approval of) the Call for Review and the questionnaire, the
Communications Team:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Sends the Call for Review to w3c-ac-members@w3.org.</li>
  <li>Sends a version of the announcement to public-new-work@w3.org
    (<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">archive</a>).
    Use this <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fpublic-charter.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template</a> (and see the
    <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2007Jan/0001.html">example</a>). The announcement must include:
    <ul>
      <li>The URI of the (public) charter.</li>
      <li>The end date of the Member review.</li>
      <li>That W3C invites public feedback on public-new-work@w3.org
	(<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">archive</a>).
      </li>
      <li>That we make no guarantees of replying to feedback. </li>
      <li>That people who work for a Member organization should
	coordinate their comments through their Advisory Committee Representative.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Send the same email <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/new-work">new-work@ietf.org</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> public-new-work@w3.org used to cc new-work@ietf.org but due to mailing list configuration issues, we stopped that practice.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in January 2007, W3C makes
all charters public <em>during</em> Advisory Committee review.</p>

<h3>5.2 <a id="review-eval" name="review-eval">Evaluating the
Review Results</a></h3>

<p>W3M evaluation of the review results proceeds the same way as <a
href="https://www.w3.org/Project/Brief/CharterApproval.html#review-eval">W3M evaluation of
Review Results</a>.</p>

<p>Beginning in July 2014, the Director <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2014JulSep/0018.html">instituted an experimental
practice when it comes to approving Working Group Charters</a>.</p>

<p>Generally, the Director will expect to receive reviews for Charter
proposals from at least 5% of the Membership, and will generally not
approve Charters without a margin of favorable reviews equal to 5% of
the Membership. Additionally, the Director will continue to consider
the number of declarations of intent to participate or implement the
output of the Working Group.</p>

<p>Given the diversity of work underway in the Consortium, including
groups that focus on horizontal reviews (e.g. accessibility, security,
and internationalization), as well as technologies that are initially
focused on by some segment of the Web's stakeholders, there are times
where exceptions to this practice may be warranted. In those cases,
the Director will document reasons why the exception is warranted.</p>

<h3 id="managing-changes">5.3 Managing Changes to Charters</h3>

<p>Very minor changes may be made in place to a charter. If there are only very minor changes to a charter resulting from the review, the (future) Director's decision includes the original charter URI and an explanation of the changes and their rationale.</p>
<p>If substantive changes are proposed in response to charter review, Team must send the charter with proposed changes, a diff, and an explanation of the changes and their rationale to all who reviewed the charter, copying the member-charters-review@w3.org member-archived mailing list, accompanied by a request for response (with a deadline of a minimum one week response time) if reviewers have concerns or if the changes would alter their reviews. If the work continues or derives from an existing Group or community effort, Team should also send the diff and a public rationale to that Group or community. These communications should note that the Director has not yet approved the charter.</p>
<p>If anyone expresses new concern in response to the re-review, Team may attempt to resolve the concern (with re-review), formally open a new AC charter review, or the Director may treat it as an objection and overrule it.</p>

<p>If there are substantive changes, before any announcement, the staff:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Mints a new URI for the version of the charter that includes the changes. In the "Charter History" section of the charter, please link to the original (reviewed) charter.</li>
<li>Modifies the original charter in place with the
following status sentence at the top:
<blockquote>
&lt;p class="todo"&gt;This charter has been replaced
      by &lt;a&gt;[a newer version]&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>6. <a id="director-decision" name="director-decision">
Announcement of Director's Decision, Call for Participation</a></h2>

<p>Please ensure that the following are done and you have documentation before requesting to announce a group:</p>

<ol>
<li>W3M has approved the group, whether or not preceded by an Advisory Committee Review</li>
<li>There is a public home page for the group</li>
<li>The group exists in IPP. If the group does not exist in IPP then
contact w3t-comm@w3.org to <a href="/admin/dashboard">create the group</a>. Note that this requires:
  <ul>
    <li>group name,</li>
    <li>group shortname</li>
    <li>charter URI,</li>
    <li>home page URI.</li>
  </ul>
Creating the group will give a group identifier that lists the group in the drop-down for db-backed groups in the mailing list creation form.</li>
<li>All relevant mailing lists exist. If not, Team Contact may <a href="/Systems/Mail/Request/">create the mailing list(s)</a>.</li>
<li>The main mailing list is associated with the group via the <a href="/2011/04/dbwg/group-services">Group Service Management</a> interface (this updates automatically the <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a>.)</li>
</ol>

<p>The Communications Team should try to minimize the number of
messages sent to the Advisory Committee, while ensuring that each
message is clear. In general, the Comm Team sends one email for group approval (Director's Decision) and call for participation (see <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2015OctDec/0043.html">sample announcement</a>), but may send the latter as a second email, and if so uses a
<a
href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2FTemplates&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fcfp.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template for the call for participation</a>.</p>

<p class=timeline><em>Timeline:</em> this takes a week at most.</p>

<h3>6.1 Organizing the Director's Decision</h3>

<p>The Team contact sends a draft combined Director's Decision and Call for
Participation to the Head of W3C Communications cc'ing w3t-comm
(<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2015OctDec/0043.html">sample
announcement of group approval</a>). The announcement must
indicate:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whether the group is approved and its charter end date.</li>
<li>The URI of the final charter.</li>
<li>Any substantive changes from the charter that was reviewed</li>
<li>Rationale for approving the group despite objections</li>
</ul>

<p>It is useful to include notice of the 45 day timeframe in case when existing participants of the Group under the previous charter need to re-join the group because a charter has new deliverables in-scope.</p>

<p>In order to avoid confusion, it's also useful to state that existing participants under the previous charter are not required to leave/re-join the group, when the new charter doesn't have new deliverables involving new patent commitment.</p>

<p>The Head of W3C Communications must approve the Director's Decision
and Call for Participation before the Communications Team sends it
to <a href="mailto:w3c-ac-members@w3.org">w3c-ac-members@w3.org</a>.
The Communications Team SHOULD announce the Director's decision within
<span class="time-interval">two weeks</span> after the end of the AC
review (or send an email setting new expectations). An announcement is
made if the proposal is approved <em>or</em> rejected.</p>

<p><strong>If the group is <em>approved</em></strong>, it is a good
practice that the Communications Team also:</p>
<ul>
  <li>forwards the Call for Participation to the Working Group's
primarily public mailing list (to notify the group, including Invited
Experts). The Results of the Call for Review and any member-only
information should be
elided. See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webassembly/2017Aug/0001.html">example</a>.</li>
  <li>follows-up on the Advance Notice in public-new-work with a
  pointer to that
  announcement. See <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2017Aug/0001.html">example</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the group is <em>rejected</em></strong>, it is a good
practice that the Communications Team follows-up on the Advance
Notice in public-new-work to close the loop for the public record.</p>

<h3><a name="join-form">6.2 Creating a Mechanism
for People to Join the Group</a></h3>

<p>The mechanism that people will use to join the group
depends on several factors.</p>

<ul>
<li>For WGs, IGs that are more than mailing lists, Systeam (or Head of Communications) <a href="/admin/dashboard">creates the group</a> (send a sysreq, cc:w3t-comm; Note that this requires a group name, shortname, charter URI, and home page URI. Creating the group will give a group identifier that will be used in mailing list requests).
<ul>
<li>If the group is already managed by <a
href="/2004/01/pp-impl/">IPP</a>, simply reuse the
join form that IPP provides; all join pages are available from the <a
href="/2004/01/pp-impl/">IPP home page</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the group is an IG that is just a mailing list, document on the group's home page that to join the group people subscribe to the list.</li>
</ul>

<!--
<p>In the case of a group making the transition to the W3C Patent
Policy (either a Working Group or an Interest Group with disclosure
obligations that is more than a mailing list), the Team Contact sends
a <a href="/2000/09/dbwg/docs#chairs">request to the Systems Team</a>
to add the group to IPP (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">interface to create a new group</a>).
-->

<p>
    All Working Groups and Interest Groups appear in their respective <a href="/groups/">group list</a> and have a
    public list of participants (except for Interest Groups that are not managed by IPP).
</p>

<!--
<p>In the case of other groups (not managed by IPP), the Team Contact
creates a form for joining the group using WBS. Please use the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/33280/psig-20041217/">PSIG join
form</a> as a starting point.</p>
-->

<!--
<p><strong>Note:</strong> For a group making the
transition to IPP, initially IPP will
list as participants all the participants that were listed in
DBWG. However, after a grace period (forty-five days per the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2003/12/22-pp-faq.html#start">PP FAQ</a>),
those participants who have not rejoined the group through IPP will
not be permitted to attend meetings. If, after the grace period, there
are discrepancies between the IPP view of participants and the DBWG
view of participants, the Comm Team will ask the Team Contact to help
resolve them.</p>
-->

<h3>6.3 Organizing the Call for Participation</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before sending the Call for Participation,
make sure the charter is public (since 2007, charters are public during AC review) and any final edits (e.g., addition of
link to page for joining the group) have been made.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#CharterReview">section 5.2.3
  of the W3C Process</a>, any Advisory Committee representative may request an extended review period of any new or substantively modified Working Group charter, if submitted with a Member’s comments in response to the Call for Review.
  Upon receipt of
  any such request, the Director must ensure that the Call for Participation for the Working Group occurs at least 60 days after the Call for Review of the charter.
</p>

<p>The Team Contact sends a draft Director's Decision and Call for Participation (CFP) to
the Communications Team (w3t-comm). See a <a
 href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2015OctDec/0043.html">
 sample announcement</a>. The announcement must
include:</p>

<ol>
<li>A link to the group charter.</li>
<li>A link to the group public home page.</li>
<li>A link to a page with information about the mechanism used
to join the group (e.g., a URI to an IPP "join" form for a group under the W3C Patent Policy).</li>
<li>Name and contact information for the Team Contact(s)</li>
</ol>

<p>The announcement must also indicate when appropriate:</p>

<ol>
<!--
<li>Whether this is a Working Group that is making the transition
to the W3C Patent Policy and has Working Drafts that are expected
to become Recommendations.</li>
-->
<li>For a newly created group, information about the dates
of the first face-to-face meeting.</li>
</ol>

<p>After sending the Director's Decision and Call for Participation:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the group has been rechartered, make sure that IPP
has the latest charter link (Comm team <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">searches</a> the group and edits information to add a new charter) </li>
<li>If the group is using IPP as the join mechanism,
Comm Team uses the <a href="https://www.w3.org/admin/dashboard">Groups DB</a> interface to
record that a Call for Participation was sent (so that all links via the Groups DB, including the charter one on the IPP join form, are actually live).</li>
<li>If the group was "staged", Systeam or Comm Team unstages it.</li>
<li>The <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a> is automatically updated from the Groups DB.</li>
<!--
<li>If the group has just made the transition to the W3C Patent
Policy, the Comm Team sends out a <a href="#cfe">Call for
Exclusions</a> for each specification with associated licensing
obligations.</li>
-->
<!--
<li>If the group is new, add link(s) to the group home page(s)
to this <a href="/2001/07/pubrules-copyright.xml">file used by several tools
</a> such as the pubrules checker.</li>
-->
<li>The public <a href="/groups/">list of groups</a> is automatically updated from the Groups DB, including a 1-paragraph description.</li>
<li>Team Contact marks the chair(s) as such in the Group's admin view (this automatically adds the chair(s) to the
<a href="/admin/othergroups/31972/show">Chairs' group</a>).</li>
<li>Function Lead or Staff Contact(s) update the Team's <a href="/2005/09/manage/">effort tables</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When we recharter a Working Group and the charter scope has changed, we enter the CFP into the Group DB, which triggers messages to the group participants that they must rejoin. If the new charter is not substantively different, do not register the new CFP.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team Contacts with questions about how an
Invited Expert joins a group should consult the <a
href="https://www.w3.org/2004/02/invited_expert">Team Policy for
Invited Experts</a>.</p>

<h2 id=timeline>Timeline for Charter creation</h2>

<p>Depending on the complexity of the charter, the time to draft and get a charter approved by the W3C Director may vary greatly.
  Each section above gives expectation on how long it takes. This section gives guidance on how to manage the overall timeline.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>You should be planning for 4 months to get a charter approved for a group, starting from scratch.
    More may be needed if the scope or deliverables are controversial.
  </li>
  <li>Some of the steps can be done in parallel.
    <ul>
      <li>request the advance notice from the strategy lead as soon as you have something to point to.</li>
      <li>Start the horizontal reviews of the charter as soon as the scope, deliverables, and dependencies
         parts of the charter are stable enough. Ping the horizontal reviwer on a weekly basis.</li>
      <li>start working on resolving any formal objection on a charter as soon as those received. Don't wait
        for the end of the AC review period.
      </li>
      <li>prepare your Director approval announcement before getting the approval from W3M</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to have the Project Management Lead (for existing groups) and/or the Strategy Lead in the
    loop.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="cfe">7.4 Organizing a Call for Exclusions</a></h3>

<p>The Comm Team sends out a Call for Exclusion either
   at the same time as a CFP (for a group making the transition) or
   approximately ninety days after the FPWD of a specification with
   associated licensing obligations (for a group already under the
   policy). IPP reminds the Comm Team automatically when to send a
   CFE (in both the transition and non-transition case) and includes
   a draft CFE in the reminder. Per <a
   href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-exclude-mech">section
   4.5 of the Patent Policy</a>, the Comm Team sends
    the announcement to "the Working
   Group mailing list and the Advisory Committee Representatives of
   all organizations participating in the Working Group." The list of
   email addresses of AC Reps of participating Members is available at
   the bottom of the DBWG page for the group; see the <a
   href="https://www.w3.org/2000/09/dbwg/groups">list of
   groups</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Patent Policy states, "In the event that a
 Working Group issues more than one Recommendation-track document, the
 exclusion procedure will be employed for each series of documents
 individually."</p>

<h3>Revision History</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>2012-08</strong>: Added section 3.4 Horizontal Review
following <a href="https://www.w3.org/2012/05/15-ac-minutes#item14"
>discussion at May 2012 AC meeting on better integration of horizontal
working groups</a> and discussion within the Team and Advisory Board.</li>
<li><strong>2015-05</strong>: Added pointer to Policy on W3C Group Charter End Dates in "Charter Extension" section.</li>
<li><strong>2015-09</strong>: Updates to Process Document section numbers and titles. Removed "Activities" and "Coordination Groups" which are no longer referenced in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/">2015 Process Document</a>.</li>
<li><strong>2016-02</strong>: Updated mostly to reflect that the Groups DB interfaces with IPP and that systeam creates new WGs/IGs; pointed to most recent sample announcement for Director's Decision and Call for Participation; updated workflows to match current practice; further removed or clarified that "Activities" are no longer in Process..</li>
<li><strong>2018-01</strong>: Took latest process into account</li>
