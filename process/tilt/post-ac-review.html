<h2 id="review-eval">TilT Evaluation of the 
    AC Review Results</h2>

<p>How TiLT manages AC review results depends on the results
themselves.  The first three cases below require TilT discussion; the
fourth only requires notification to TiLT.</p>

<h3>Case 1: There are Unresolved Formal Objections</h3>

<p>The charter shepherd <a href="#TiLT-report">reports</a> the review
  results to TiLT for discussion and <a
  href='https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose'>requests the start
  of a Council</a>.</p>

<h3>Case 2: There are Changes</h3>

<p>If there are no unresolved Formal Objections but there are changes
to the charter &mdash;either requested by reviewers or resulting from
resolution of Formal Objections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The charter shepherd changes the charter and notifies all
    of the AC Reps who replied to the call for review. These AC Reps have
    7-10 days to express dissent.</li>
  <li>In parallel or subsequently, the charter shepherd also
    <a href="#TiLT-report">reports</a> the review results to TiLT. That message
    should highlight the same (7-10 day) window for TiLT to request discussion
    of the changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the time period elapses without dissent by AC Reps and TiLT gave its
  <a href="./#timing">approval</a>,
  the charter shepherd proceeds directly to 
<a href="../charter.html#director-decision">requesting
  announcement of the charter</a>. Otherwise, TiLT discussion takes
place. Upon subsequent approval, the charter shepherd
<a href="../charter.html#director-decision">requests announcement</a>.</p>

<h3>Case 3: Uncontroversial Review but TiLT Approval Required</h3>

<p>If there are no Formal Objections and no changes, then there are
  still two scenarios when TiLT approval is required:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In the TiLT decision to request AC review, there was
      a requirement to discuss the AC review results whatever the outcome
      (e.g., to assign FTE based on the level Member support).</li>
  <li>The review did not reach the 5% threshold and TiLT did not
    relax that requirement in the decision to seek AC review.</li>
</ul>

<p>In either case, the charter shepherd <a href="#TiLT-report">reports</a>
  the review results. That message should highlight that the review was
  uncontroversial and point out which topics now require TiLT
  approval. Upon subsequent approval, the charter shepherd
<a href="../charter.html#director-decision">requests announcement of the charter</a>.</p>

<h3>Case 4: Uncontroversial Review and No TiLT Approval Required</h3>

<p>The charter shepherd <a href="#TiLT-report">reports</a> the review
  results to TiLT and indicates that the charter is deemed approved and
  no further TiLT approval is required.</p>

<p>The charter shepherd then
  <a href="../charter.html#director-decision">requests announcement of the charter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="TiLT-report">Reporting AC Review Results to TiLT</h3>

<p>In all of the above cases, the charter shepherd reports the review
outcomes to <a
href='https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose'>TiLT</a> with the
following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>The distribution of reviews. It helps to highlight either that there have been
  Formal Objections or that there is Consensus.</li>

<li>A record of any substantial review comments and replies to those comments. In particular, for any Formal Objection, whether:
  <ul>
    <li>No attempt has been made to resolve it.</li>
    <li>An attempt has been made to resolve it but it has remained unresolved
      (e.g., because the reviewer did not respond, or no agreement can be reached).</li>
    <li>It has been resolved. In this case indicate the resolution and whether
      that involved changes to the charter.</li>
    <li>It has been overridden by a Council (e.g, deemed out of scope or
      overruled for any other reason).</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>A list of proposed changes to the charter (such as a link to one or more pull requests),
  and whether those changes were requested during the review or as a result of resolving
  a Formal Objection.</li>

<li>Pertinent IPR statements, if any</li>
</ul>
