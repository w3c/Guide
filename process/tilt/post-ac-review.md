title: TilT Evaluation of the AC Review Results
toc: no
---

How [TiLT](./) manages AC review results depends on
the results themselves. The first three cases below require TilT
discussion; the fourth only requires notification to TiLT.
{:#TiLT-report}

## Case 1: There are Unresolved Formal Objections

The charter shepherd [reports](#TiLT-report) the review results to TiLT for discussion and [requests the start of a Council](https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose).

## Case 2: There are Changes

If there are no unresolved Formal Objections but there are changes to the charter â€”either requested by reviewers or resulting from resolution of Formal Objections:

- The charter shepherd changes the charter and notifies all of the AC Reps who replied to the call for review. These AC Reps have 7-10 days to express dissent.
- In parallel or subsequently, the charter shepherd also [reports](#TiLT-report) the review results to TiLT. That message should highlight the same (7-10 day) window for TiLT to request discussion of the changes.

If the time period elapses without dissent by AC Reps and TiLT gave its [approval](./#timing), the charter shepherd proceeds directly to [requesting announcement of the charter](../charter.md#announce-decision). Otherwise, TiLT discussion takes place. Upon subsequent approval, the charter shepherd [requests announcement](../charter.md#announce-decision).

## Case 3: Uncontroversial Review but TiLT Approval Required

If there are no Formal Objections and no changes, then there are still two scenarios when TiLT approval is required:

- In the TiLT decision to request AC review, there was a requirement to discuss the AC review results whatever the outcome (e.g., to assign FTE based on the level Member support).
- The review did not reach the 5% threshold and TiLT did not relax that requirement in the decision to seek AC review.

In either case, the charter shepherd [reports](#TiLT-report) the review results. That message should highlight that the review was uncontroversial and point out which topics now require TiLT approval. Upon subsequent approval, the charter shepherd [requests announcement of the charter](../charter.md#announce-decision).

## Case 4: Uncontroversial Review and No TiLT Approval Required

The charter shepherd [reports](#TiLT-report) the review results to TiLT and indicates that the charter is deemed approved and no further TiLT approval is required.

The charter shepherd then [requests announcement of the charter](../charter.md#announce-decision).

## Reporting AC Review Results to TiLT {#TiLT-report}

In all of the above cases, the charter shepherd reports the review outcomes to [TiLT](https://github.com/w3c/tilt-private/issues/new/choose) with the following information:

- The distribution of reviews. It helps to highlight either that there have been Formal Objections or that there is Consensus.
- A record of any substantial review comments and replies to those comments. In particular, for any Formal Objection, whether:
  
  - No attempt has been made to resolve it.
  - An attempt has been made to resolve it but it has remained unresolved (e.g., because the reviewer did not respond, or no agreement can be reached).
  - It has been resolved. In this case indicate the resolution and whether that involved changes to the charter.
  - It has been overridden by a Council (e.g, deemed out of scope or overruled for any other reason).
- A list of proposed changes to the charter (such as a link to one or more pull requests), and whether those changes were requested during the review or as a result of resolving a Formal Objection.
- Pertinent IPR statements, if any.
