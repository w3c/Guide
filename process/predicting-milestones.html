      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <h3 id="aims">Aims and Scope</h3>
      <p>This document is intended to help in predicting milestones for work on
        the W3C Standards track. Realistic milestones are important for resource
        allocation at the start of new work, and to monitor progress when
        rechartering or extending existing work. At the same time, the very
        nature of the work means that progress is somewhat unpredictable; <em>delays
          can and will occur</em> relative to the predicted schedule.</p>
      <p>Delays are not necessarily a bad thing. For example, delays due to an
        unexpectedly large volume of last call comments may improve the
        specification or may indicate that what was previously considered a
        simple problem is actually more complex. Delays due to incomplete
        implementations may indicate that implementers disagree on the meaning
        of the specification, or that priorities have shifted away to other
        work. So these delays may indicate where the work needs to be improved.
        Delay, and a better specification, is usually preferable to a rapidly
        produced but poor quality specification that needs to be revised,
        substantially reworked, or abandoned and replaced because it was
        unsuitable. </p>
      <p>If eventual timescales to Recommendation are unpredictable, should
        milestones be abandoned altogether? No. Some indication is needed to
        judge the likely scope of the work. What <em>can</em> be done is to
        produce <em>realistic</em> initial schedules, based on past experience,
        and to clearly communicate the reasons for delays and the lessons
        learned from them when adjusting milestones as the work progresses.</p>
      <h3 id="this">Reading this document</h3>
      <p>While the technical work undertaken by W3C is very diverse and hard to
        generalize, non-technical aspects such as required review periods
        mandated by the Process Document [<a href="/policies/process/">PROCESS</a>]
        or the W3C Patent Policy [<a href="/policies/patent-policy/">W3CPP</a>]
        are common to all work. The main focus of this document is therefore on
        the required periods of time needed for the non-technical work.
        Understanding these avoids producing initial milestones which are
        unreasonably short and thus, inevitably destined to 'fail'. Alongside
        each of these time periods, tips are given on how to minimize delays.</p>
      <p>This document aims to collect together some of that experience so that
        new Chairs, Team Contacts, and Advisory Committee representatives can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Produce charters with realistic initial milestones</li>
        <li>Understand how to minimize avoidable delays</li>
        <li>Cope with and draw lessons from unpredicted delays</li>
        <li>Clearly communicate why and by how much an initial timeline has been
          revised as work proceeds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Throughout the document, minimum time durations are documented, <span
          class="time">styled like this;</span> supported by hints and tips on
        avoiding needless delay, <span class="tip">styled like this.</span></p>
      <p>This document is an informal guide to predicting the likely duration of
        Recommendation-track work. It is not a normative definition of the
        various time periods; for that, follow the links to the Process Document
        and the Patent Policy.</p>
      <h2 id="prep">Preparatory work</h2>
      <p>The first set of milestones are drawn up before work starts, and put in
        an initial charter. In this phase, an idea is firmed up from "hey we
        could do this" to a fully fledged, chartered Working Group. If the work
        is entirely new, or would take an existing group in a radical new
        direction, the Process Document <a href="/policies/process/#WGCharterDevelopment">requires</a>
        that Advance Notice be sent to the AC. Often, an initial draft charter
        is sent along with this notice (but this is not required). The aim here
        is to avoid surprises, to quickly gather brainstorming-type feedback,
        and to get buy-in on the proposed direction from likely members of the
        eventual Working Group. </p>
      <dl id="advance-notice" class="time">
        <dt>Advance Notice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There is no set period for Advance Notice, but four weeks is a
            typical minimum period.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl class="tip">
        <dt>Advance Notice</dt>
        <dd>
          <p id="fair-warning">When developing materials for and advance notice,
            try to strike a balance between fast (but overly sketchy and vague)
            and thorough (but slow, maybe over-detailed or over-constraining).</p>
          <p if="build-on-existing">If work has been prepared beforehand in a
            Community group, or formalizes existing, industry standard
            practices, then an Advance Notice might be skipped.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>The results from Advance Notice may indicate broad consensus on the
        proposed direction (if so, proceed rapidly to a formal charter review).
        Or they may indicate disagreement on the best direction forward (in
        which case, iterate). Some commentors may want a fast development of an
        initial version, while others may want a fully fledged solution.</p>
      <dl class="tip">
        <dt>Advance Notice Feedback</dt>
        <dd>
          <p id="scope-v2">If feedback indicates disagreement on scope, consider
            proposing both a fast initial version <em>and</em> a requirements
            gathering and drafting item for a full-featured second version. This
            will help avoid delays due to disagreements on scope.</p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Once broad agreement is reached, a draft charter is created (or
        updated, if one was sent with the Advance Notice) and reviewed by W3M
        before being sent to the AC.</p>
      <dl id="w3m-review" class="time">
        <dt>W3M review</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There is no set period for W3M review, but two reviewers are needed

            Save time by identifying likely chairs during the Advance Notice

            been identified during Advance Notice, communicate this to W3M so
            that they can see that the proposed work has developer backing.</p>
          <p id="dependency">Clearly distinguish in the charter between Groups
            with a formal dependency, and other related groups. This distinction
            will be important during Candidate Recommendation.
            <!-- the charter generator does not make this distinction, which is a problem --></p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>Once review comments from W3M have been incorporated into the charter,
        it is <a href="/policies/process/#CharterReview">sent

          <p>There is no set period for AC review, but four weeks is a typical

        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2 id="wg-startup">Starting the Group</h2>
      <p>Once the decision to start the Working Group has been communicated to
        the AC, participants can join. This may take some time, particularly if
        participants need to perform a legal review of the work items (for
        example, to review their patent portfolio in light of the <a href="/policies/patent-policy/#sec-Requirements">W3C
          Royalty-Free commitment</a>). In the case of a new group, some or all
        of the participants may be unfamiliar with W3C processes, tools (such as
        IRC, phone conferencing, issue tracking, version control). The Chair and
        Staff Contact take a lead role in getting a new group up to productive
        speed.</p>
      <dl id="startup" class="time">
        <dt>WG startup</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>There is no set period until a Group starts to become productive.
            Experienced participants with a capable Chair and Team Contact,
            working on a new version of an existing specification can be
            productive immediately. A new group with participants new to W3C,
            working in a new area which is rife with Intellectual property
            concerns, may take several months to become productive.</p>

        <dd>
          <p id="charter-diff">Make a diff document of the final charter,
            compared to the one sent for AC review. Legal review can focus on
            just what has changed.</p>
          <p id="infrastructure">As soon as the decision is made to charter the
            group, set up the usual infrastructure (public web page, archived
            mailing lists(s), wiki, issue and action tracker) so that
            participants are not kept waiting and so that they become used to
            the way of working.</p>
          <p id="first call">Establish a day and time for a first telephone call
            (based on the geographic location of the participants) to get people
            introduced and up to speed. Do not expect to accomplish any
            technical work at first.</p>
          <p id="editors">Identify likely editors early.</p>
          <p id="actions">Ensure that participants are familiar with the action
            tracking as soon as possible.</p>
          <div id="tracking-system">
            <p>Establish a system for recording and tracking actionable
            comments on the specification. That system might be:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>an open mechanism, such as the 
              <a href="https://github.com/w3c">the W3C GitHub</a>
              (which would enable commenters to submit comments on the
               specification directly into the tracking system directly themselves)</li>
              <li>a moderated mechanism, such as GitHub issues
              (which would enable the working-group to control which comments
               actually get entered into the system as issues for the group)</li>
              <li>some combination of open and moderated mechanisms; for
               example, using the W3C Bugzilla service for first-level
               comment tracking, with the editor responsible for resolving
               comments, and using the W3C Tracker tool for comments that
               have been “escalated” for resolution by the working group as a whole.</li>
            </ul>
           <p>Use the tracking system at all phases of the life cycle of the 
           specification. An advantage of setting up such a tracking system early and
           using it as part of the working group’s normal operating
           procedures is that the same system can later also be used during
           Candidate Recommendation, for tracking Candidate Recommendation comments. So it can help the
           working group to proceed through Candidate Recommendation more quickly—because
           by the time the specification reaches Candidate Recommendation, the working
           group will already have long experience and familiarity with
           using a system for recording and tracking comments, and will save the
           start-up time they would otherwise need to spend during Candidate Recommendation to get
           accustomed to using a new and unfamiliar comment-tracking system for the
           first time.</p>

      </dl>
      <p>A face to face meeting can be a helpful way to build social bonds and

      <h2 id="fpwd">First Public Working Draft</h2>
      <p>The First Public Working Draft is an important milestone. It makes
        concrete the proposed work. It is an opportunity to publicize the work
        of the Group. This is also a legal milestone; FPWD triggers a patent
        exclusion period for all features that are in that document. Features <em>added
          afterwards</em> are not covered until the work progresses to a Last
        Call. There is therefore a balance to be struck between speed and
        feature completeness (at least an outline of the features; details of
        syntax and specification for a given feature can be altered later).</p>

      <h2 id="test">Test suites</h2>
      <p>The W3C Process does not require tests to be available until exiting
        Candidate Recommendation. Leaving testing until it is the only thing
        left holding you back from Proposed Recommendation is, however, unwise.
        Tests give implementers something to work with, and provide examples for
        those reviewing the specification. Tests help make concrete the
        sometimes abstract language of a specification. Tests can show where
        reasonable interpretations of the same specification text could lead to
        divergent and non-interoperable implementations.</p>

      <p>Once all open issues are closed (or deferred to the next version) and

        <dt>Processing Wide Review comments</dt>
        <dd>
          <p id="horiz-longer">Deal with comments as they come in, rather than
            waiting until the end of the wide review period. Besides saving time,
            this can also avoid duplicate comments.</p>
          <p id="DoC">Maintain a draft Disposition of Comments. This allows
            commentors to see that their comment has been received and what the
            status of the response is. It also allows the Working Group to track
            the overall progress of the review. The Disposition of Comments will
            be needed during transition to CR.</p>
          <p id="ED">Keep an Editors Draft up-to-date with changes made as a
            result of wide review comments, so that commentors can see the changes
            in place. This speeds sign-off on the changes.</p>
          <p>If a Group is expected to comment and has not done so, ask if they
            need more time. This encourages them to either make their comments
            on time, or ask for an extension of known duration. Also ask that,
            if they have no comments, they send an explicit 'no comments'
            message. This helps 'show wide review' in the following Transition
            call, and differentiates groups whose review is complete from groups
            which are late.</p>
          <p id="vague">If review comments are vague, ask for clarification or
            for concrete specification text which would satisfy the comment.</p>
          <p id="sweeping">If review comments are overly ambitious and would
            exceed the planned scope of the current specification, ask if they
            can be deferred to the next version.</p>
          <p id="lc-disagree">If a reviewer and the Working Group cannot reach
            agreement on a proposed change, give the reviewer a choice of
            accepting the change anyway ('can live with it') or filing a formal
            objection.</p>
          <p id="unresponsive">If changes are made in response to a comment and
            the reviewer does not react to repeated requests for confirmation
            that the changes are acceptable, send a final reminder stating that
            failure to respond by a given date will be taken as a sign that the
            changes are acceptable. Document the number of reminders sent and
            their dates, then move on.</p>

      <h2 id="transition-cr">Transition to CR</h2>
      <p>Once the Disposition of Comments shows that all wide review
        comments have been handled, your Group can request a transition to
        Candidate Recommendation. At that meeting, besides checking the
        responses and looking for outstanding disagreement, you will be asked
        which <a href="/policies/process/#candidate-rec">features
          are at risk</a>, what the CR exit criteria are, and to give a <a href="/policies/process/#candidate-rec">mimimum
          time for CR</a>. The purpose of that minimum time is to allow other
        implementers, perhaps unknown to the group, to contribute their
        implementation feedback.</p>
      <p>Although having a Test Suite and an Implementation report at this stage
        is not required, it is highly recommended. Firstly, if the report shows
        implementation of each feature by at least two independent
        implementations, it is possible to exit CR quickly (a Call for Exclusion might delay a bit). Secondly, an early Implementation report helps to
        identify features which are currently not well implemented so that the
        Group can discuss whether these features need to be marked as 'at risk'.</p>
      <p>This section assumes that the earlier tips were followed and you have a
        test suite.</p>

          <p>There is a minimum duration of 28 days for comments for CR. Two
            months is a more typical figure. For follow-on CR publications, two weeks
            is a realistic minimum.</p>

          <p id="long-cr">Historically, the time taken to exit CR varied from
            zero (rare) to many years, largely due to the absence of test suites
            sufficiently early in the process.</p>
          <p id="predicting-existing-cr">By the time a Group is ready to enter
            CR, it should be possible to estimate with more confidence the
            likely duration, provided there is an existing Test Suite and draft
            implementation Report, and provided the Group is able to gauge the
            momentum of implementers.</p>

          <p id="few-late-comments">In practice, it is common to get no comments
            in such a late CR, because the implementers already agreed to
            drop/add whatever feature triggered the new CR. However, other
            implementers or dependent groups may have other ideas on the
