    <h1>How to Close a Working Group</h1>
  </div>
  <p class="baseline">This <strong>Guidebook</strong> is the collected
    wisdom of the W3C Group Chairs, team contacts and other contributors.</p>

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>The W3C Process describes
the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#group-lifecyle">lifecycle
of chartered groups</a>. 
At a high level, W3C closes a Working Group
once it has completed it's work.
</p>

<h2 id="normal">Normal Closure</h2>

<p>
    Sometimes, after successful completion,
    the Group is left open to perform <strong>maintenance</strong>;
    other times, it is closed and a Community Group performs this function.
</p>

<h2 id="early">Early closure</h2>

<p>Exceptionally, a group may be closed before it has completed its work:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Insufficient resources</dt>
    <dd>There is insufficient developer or implementer interest
        to sustain the group, and the Team proposes to close it.
    </dd>

    <dt>PAG outcome</dt>
    <dd>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Exception">Patent Advisory Group</a> has determined
        that essential claims exist which cannot be circumvented;
        so it will not be possible to create a Recommendation
        which can be freely implemented under the
        W3C Royalty-Free Patent Policy;
        thus, it is proposed that the group should be closed.
    </dd>

    <dt>Considered detrimental</dt>
    <dd>The AB or the TAG determined that
        continued operation of the groups
        would be harmful to the Web or to W3C.
    </dd>

    <dt>Finished early</dt>
    <dd>All the Recommendation-track deliverables
        have been completed early,
        and no other work in scope of the current charter
        remains to be done.
        The options are to just let the charter run until it expires,
        or to formally close the group early.
    </dd>
</dl>

<p>
    A proposal to close a Group before the end of it's chartered term
    must be explained. An Advisory Committee review takes place
    and, if that confirms that the group should be closed,
    a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#def-w3c-decision">W3C Decision</a> announces closure of the group.
</p>

<p>
    Note that, if the Group has Recommendation-track specifications in development,
    and they have not yet reached W3C Recommendation status,
    closing the group 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-disclosure-termination">
    terminates Disclosure Obligations</a> for those specifications.
</p>

<p>
    There is <em>Team-only</em> documentation of the 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/04/closing-group.html">detailed steps for closing a group.</a>
