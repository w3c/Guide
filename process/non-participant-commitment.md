This is Team guidance for implementation of [Process 6.2.6](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#contributor-license). If you have any IPR questions, and for substantial contributions, please contact [team-legal](mailto:team-legal @ w3.org).

When a non-Member (or not-yet-identified Member) makes a pull request contribution to a W3C Working Group repository, the repository manager tool flags it for review and sends them an email with [this text](https://github.com/w3c/ash-nazg/blob/master/templates/affiliation-mail.txt) to the contributor, chairs, and team contacts.

1. If the contributor is a Member participating in the WG, link the GitHub account to the Member-affiliated W3C account and re-validate.

1. If the contributor is a Member not participating in the WG, first encourage them to join the WG. If they won't, and this is a one-off contribution, follow the flow below. 
  
1. If the contribution is non-substantive, e.g. fixing a typo, mark it as non-substantive (which clears the IPR flag).

1. If the contributor is not an affiliate of a current W3C Member, the Team follows up with them to see:

   - Do they work for an organization who should be a Member?

      1. Try to recruit them to membership
   
      1. Get a *non-participant license commitment* 

   - Are they independent?

      1. Should we invite them as an [Invited Expert](https://www.w3.org/invited-experts/)?
  
      1. Get a *non-participant license commitment* from the [repository manager](https://labs.w3.org/repo-manager/). See the [project review slides](https://www.w3.org/2019/12/05-dak-nplc/) for more details on how to get the non-participant licensing commitment
