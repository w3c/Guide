Some Working Groups define API definitions, with examples and are still using the [W3C document license](https://www.w3.org/copyright/document-license-2023/).

If you include WebIDL definitions, examples, code samples, the [document license](https://www.w3.org/copyright/document-license-2023/) states (as of January 1st, 2023):

{% include quote.html content="In addition, 'Code Components' — Web IDL in sections clearly marked as Web IDL; and W3C-defined markup (HTML, CSS, etc.) and computer programming language code clearly marked as code examples— are licensed under the [W3C Software License](https://www.w3.org/copyright/software-license/)."%}

The [W3C Software License](https://www.w3.org/copyright/software-license-2023/) is listed at the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses/W3C).
