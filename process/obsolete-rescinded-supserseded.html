      </h2>
      <p>A superseded specification is one that the W3C community has decided that a newer version should be recommended for new adoption instead.</p>

<p>The status of a superseded specification remains active under the W3C Patent Policy, but it is not recommended for future implementation.</p>

<p>If the W3C community discovers at a later date that the reasons for superseding a specification are no longer valid, the process may be reversed.</p>

<p>More information on the process for superseding a specification can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-rescind">section 6.9 of the W3C Process</a>.</p>

<p>If you think that a specification has been superseded in error, please <a href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">contact the W3C</a>. </p>

<h2>
    <a name="obsolete" id="obsolete">Obsolete specifications</a>
  </h2>
  <p>An obsolete specification is one that the W3C community has decided should no longer be used. For example, it may no longer represent best practices, or it may not have received wide adoption and seems unlikely to do so in the future.</p>

<p>The status of an obsolete specification remains active under the W3C Patent Policy, but it is not recommended for future implementation.</p>

<p>If the W3C community discovers at a later date that the reasons for a specification becoming obsolete are no longer valid, the process may be reversed.</p>

<p>More information on the process for making a specification obsolete can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-rescind">section 6.9 of the W3C Process</a>.</p>

<p>If you think that a specification has been made obsolete in error, please <a href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">contact the W3C</a>. </p>

  <h2>
        <a name="rescinded" id="rescinded">Rescinded specifications</a>
      </h2>

      <p>A rescinded specification is one that the W3C community has decided to withdraw. For example, it may contain many errors that conflict with a more recent version, or it may face patent claims that cannot be resolved and which affect implementation.</p>

<p>When a specification has been rescinded, it is no longer used and no new licenses are granted under the W3C Patent Policy.</p>

<p>More information on the process for rescinding a specification can be found in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#rec-rescind">section 6.9 of the W3C Process</a>.</p>

<p>If you think that a specification has been rescinded in error, please <a href="mailto:webreq@w3.org">contact the W3C</a>.</p>
