    <h2>Charter Review</h2>
    <p>From time to time a Working Group or Interest Group will not have
      completed its work prior to the end date of its group charter.&nbsp; The
      Director may entertain requests to extend the charter.&nbsp; The Advisory
      Board has asked the CEO to monitor charter end dates and group progress more
      closely and in particular to clarify the status of a group that wishes to
      continue to work past the end of its charter.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>On a quaterly basis, <a href="https://www.w3.org/staff/strat/">Strategy</a>
        will review the
        progress of all chartered groups and the Team Contacts will present a plan
        for each Group whose charter will have expired prior to the following
        quarterly review meeting. Team Contacts are encouraged to look ahead
        further than the next review meeting and report expectations for groups
        whose charter expires within six months of each review meeting.</li>
      <li>Strategy will review each such plan during the quarterly meetings and reach
        an approved consensus plan.&nbsp; The Advisory Board encourages the Team to
        grant charter extensions sparingly.</li>
      <li>Any approved plan that re-charters a group, extends a charter,
	or closes a Group must be
        announced to the Membership, with rationale, prior to the current
        charter expiration.</li>
      <li>Any approved plan to defer a decision; e.g. to see if the group
        reaches a specific milestone, must specify the date of a regular weekly
        Strategy meeting where a decision will be taken.&nbsp; The date for this Strategy
        discussion must be no later than
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha; margin-top: 1em;">
          <li>one month prior to the charter expiration if an AC review of the
            change to the charter is not expected or</li>
          <li style="margin-top:0">three months prior to the charter expiration
            if an AC review of the proposed change to the charter might be
            conducted. </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Whether or not an AC review is conducted, a decision on the current
          charter of the Group must be announced to the Membership, with
          rationale, prior to the charter expiration.&nbsp; TiLT may grant short
          charter extensions if AC review has not completed prior to the current
          charter end date.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Publication Requests on behalf of a Group whose charter has expired
        more than five business days prior to the date of publication will be
        denied.&nbsp; This five business day allowance is meant only to
        accommodate unforeseen circumstances out of the Group's control.</li>
      <li>Any Group whose charter has expired should not request nor should it
        expect W3C Staff support.  Strategy may choose to continue some level of
        Staff support.  Changes in Staff support decided by Function Leads will be
        communicated to the chair(s) of the Group.</li>
    </ol>
