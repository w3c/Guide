    <p>
      From time to time a Community Group that has been <a href="../incubation.html">incubating a technology</a>
      seeks to advance it to the W3C Recommendation track in a Working Group.
      Our goal through this document is to ease that transition.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Preparation
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following questions can help a Community Group to prepare for the
      transition of work to a Working Group.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Is the work ready for standardization?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Please see elsewhere in the Guide: <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Guide/standards-track/">W3C Recommendation Track
      Readiness Best Practices</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What is the target Working Group and the relation to the CG?
    </h3>
    <p>
      If the Working Group does not yet exist, the Community Group can prepare
      by <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html">drafting a
      Working Group charter</a>. Otherwise, if the group exists but the new
      work is not within its scope W3C needs to <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Guide/process/charter.html">recharter the group</a>
      to accommodate the new work.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charter of the target Working Group should address two topics:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The list of any deliverables transferred from a Community Group.
      </li>
      <li>The nature of the working relationship between the Working Group and
      the Community Group (if any) for any deliverable originated by the
      Community Group.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      @@@TODO extract more from <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/issues/262">charter template
      discussion</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Community Group chairs should keep the Community Group participants aware
      of the progress on the transition roadmap, in particular if it involves
      chartering or re-chartering a Working Group.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Is there a record of Community Group support for the transition?
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is useful to record whether and how the Community Group reached
      consensus on the transition (in a manner consistent with its practices).
      The consensus should include expectations about the working relationship
      with the Working Group moving forward.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Are IPR commitments in place?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Community Groups have a "two-step IPR policy" so that people make
      lightweight commitments when work starts and more comprehensive
      commitments once work is mature.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Initially, a participant makes certain commitments regarding their
      own Contribution under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/process/cla/">W3C Community
      Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA)</a>.
      </li>
      <li>Later, a participant can make a voluntary commitment regarding the
      entire specification under the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/agreements/final/">W3C Community
      Final Specification Agreement (FSA)</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By comparison, under the W3C Patent Policy for Working Groups,
      participants make full specification commitments upon joining the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are thus two ways to procure commitments by Community Group
      contributors to the full text of a specification transferred to a Working
      Group:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>They join (or already participate in) the Working Group, or
      </li>
      <li>They make a commitment under the Final Specification Agreement.
      <strong>Note:</strong> FSA commitments may still have some value for
      situations where a Working Group ultimately does not advance the
      specification on the Recommendation Track.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Each Community Group should make a determination whether to launch the
      process of gathering Final Specification commitments, based on
      (anticipated or actual) Contributor participation in the Working Group. The Community Group Web
      site includes <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/community/about/faq/#fsa-mechanics">tools</a> to
      request and collect "Final Spec" commitments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the work transitions to a Working Group, that Working Group's patent
      policy becomes the "primary" patent policy. Contributions to the work are
      henceforth made under the W3C Patent Policy. When a contributor cannot join the Working Group, W3C will provide tools so that Working Groups can ensure that substantive contributions from non-participants are made under the terms of the W3C Patent Policy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      How can Community Group Participants remain involved in the work after
      the transition?
    </h3>
    <p>
      In many cases, Community Group participants will want to continue their
      involvement in discussions about a work after it has been transferred to
      a Working Group.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If a Community Group participant works for a <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/list">W3C Member</a>, the
      participant can ask their Advisory Committee Representative to join the
      Working Group.
      </li>
      <li>Otherwise, please contact <a href="mailto:abird@w3.org">Alan Bird</a>
      to explore <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/membership">W3C
      Membership</a>. During that exploration, <a href=

      </li>
    </ul>

      Operations
    </h2>
    <h3>
      GitHub Repository Management
    </h3>
    <p>
      W3C has a number of GitHub mechanisms in place for specification
      development and to help manage IPR commitments for contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a Community Group repository is hosted in a GitHub organization not
      yet used by W3C to host Recommendation work:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Will the repository itself be transitioned to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c">W3C GitHub organization</a>?
      </li>
      <li>If not, is the repository owner willing to grant admin rights to
      @w3cbot (which is used to help with managing operational matters on W3C
      work, including for horizontal review and IPR management)?
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Is the repository already being monitored by <a href=
      "https://labs.w3.org/repo-manager/">W3C's IPR Repo Manager</a>?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If not, evaluate even more carefully the IPR considerations described
      above.
      </li>
      <li>If yes, once the transition is enacted (e.g., when the new Working
      Group is launched), the IPR manager will need to be updated to reflect
      the new IPR status of the work (contact <a href=
      "mailto:dom@w3.org">dom@w3.org</a> or <a href=
      "mailto:plh@w3.org">plh@w3.org</a>); if the repo is being moved or
      renamed at the time of transition, please coordinate specifically with
      <a href="mailto:dom@w3.org">dom@w3.org</a> as this operation requires
      special handling at the moment.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other repository admin for the target Working Group:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If not already set up that way, consider <a href=
      "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/spec-prod/2021JanMar/0017.html">moving
      away from using <code>master</code> as the name of the default branch</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Other repository admin for W3C staff.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Request that the systems team back up the org repositories.
      </li>
      <li>Update or add LICENSE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md to
      reflect the new contribution framework.
      </li>
      <li>Configure the repository with the <a href=
      "https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#working_with_horizontal_review_labels">
        labels used for tracking horizontal reviews</a>
      </li>
      <li>If not already set up, make sure members of the
      <code>horizontal-admin</code> team have triage access to the repo.
      </li>
      <li>Make w3cbot a co-owner of the org (useful for integrating the IPR
      manager among other things).
      </li>
      <li>Update <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c/validate-repos/blob/main/validate.js#L9">validate-repo
      to monitor the repos of that org</a>.
      </li>
