<p>An organization's AC Rep may designate an Alternate AC Rep, which designation persists until the AC Rep changes or revokes it. Any other action the AC Rep is entitled to take (e.g. responding to AC reviews, voting in elections, joining a group, approving participation requests) may be completed by the AC Rep or Alternate, and binds the organization to the same extent as if the AC Rep had acted. In the event of multiple responses to a request for organizational input, the last response before deadline controls. (Ideally, a shared dashboard helps them coordinate.)</p>

<p>
Alternates receive the same email notifications and list subscriptions as AC Reps, and may attend meetings and calls. All participants are asked to ensure that people know "with which hat" they are speaking when commenting, and to avoid overwhelming message frequency.
