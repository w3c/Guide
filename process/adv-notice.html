<p>This document describes the <a href="https://www.w3.org/staff/strat/">Strategy
Team</a>'s <a href="#policy">implementation</a> of
the <a href="/policies/process/#WGCharterDevelopment">Process
Document requirements</a> related to advance notice to the Advisory
Committee of charters in development. See the
<a href="#bg">background</a> for the advance notice policy and
this document.</p>

<h2 id="policy">Sending advance notice to the Advisory Committee</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Who/Where</dt>
<dd>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/staff/strat/">Strategy team</a> determines when
to inform the AC of work-in-progress. These announcements are sent by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/staff/comm/">W3C Communications Team</a>
to w3c-ac-members@w3.org and then forwarded to:
  chairs@w3.org.</p>
<p>Unless an advance notice strongly requires
Member-only confidentiality (which should be rare), we also inform the
public
via <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/">public-new-work@w3.org</a> (
see <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-new-work/2022Mar/0012.html">example</a>) and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/new-work">new-work@ietf.org</a>. This
is done by the W3C Communications Team.</p>
</dd>

<dt>When</dt>
<dd>
<p>Specialists, in conjunction with the Strategy Lead, make this
decision based on early assessment of the factors available in the
"<a href='https://github.com/w3c/strategy/blob/master/3.Evaluation.md'>Evaluation</a>" section of the Funnel,
as well as considering when it is useful to encourage broader input to
discussion. In the Process-required notice to the AC, the Strategy
team will give an early status report on the work and likely timeline
for further progress (from information captured in the Funnel).</p>
<p>Advance notice is not an indication that work *will* necessarily be
sent for charter review, but an indication that the Team is seriously
evaluating possible work, and seeks wider feedback.
</p>
</dd>

<dt>How/What</dt>
<dd>
<p>There is
a <a href="https://www.w3.org/new-doc-from-template?location=%2FTeam%2F&amp;template=%2Fafs%2Fw3.org%2Fpub%2FWWW%2FTeam%2FTemplates%2Fadv-charter.html&amp;submit=Continue...">template
for advance notice</a>. Please look for recent examples in
the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/">w3c-ac-members
archive</a>.</p>

<p>The advance notice announcement to the Membership MUST include this
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>A summary of the intended work</li>
<li>A statement welcoming the Members to
use w3c-ac-forum for general expressions
of interest and support.</li>
<li>A request that Members send substantive comments and engage
on substantive discussion on a different mailing list or github repository
(i.e., <strong>other than w3c-ac-forum</strong>).</li>
<li>If applicable, a statement that the archive of this second list
is Member-visible.</li>
<li>Contact information if people have questions; generally these will
be the names of one or more people on the Team.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advance notice announcement to the Membership SHOULD include this
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Expectations about when a formal Advisory Commitee Review might begin.</li>
</ul>

<p>The advance notice announcement to the Membership MAY include this
information:</p>

<ul>
<li>Pointers to draft materials. In other words, the announcement is
not required to include a draft charter, but if one is available,
please include it.</li>
<li>Information about other mailing lists for comments, as the
situation requires.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="bg">Background for this document</h2>

<p>The <a href="/policies/process/#WGCharterDevelopment">Process Document requirements</a> for
advance notice were introduced in response to requests from Members to
be more in the loop earlier for work in development. These
requirements were added to provide additional transparency to
some work carried out (in general) by the Team,
to encourage Members to show support for work
in development early (on w3c-ac-forum), and to enable those interested in
shaping a charter to participate on a separate list (so as not to
flood w3c-ac-forum).</p>

<p>Hence the sentence in the Process Document: "<i></i>Advisory Committee
representatives MAY provide feedback on the Advisory
Committee discussion list or via other designated channels.</i>"</p>

<p>These ideas are further discussed in <cite><a
href="http://www.w3.org/2002/05/rec-tips">Tips for Getting to
Recommendation Faster</a></cite>, in particular:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When a Charter is proposed to the Advisory Committee, garner support from fellow W3C Members on w3c-ac-forum. When there is substantial support for new work among the Members, the Team may create a special mailing list for discussion among Members and Team about Group charter development. Start discussions with proposals, calendars, statements of expected resource commitments, and other such signals.</p>
