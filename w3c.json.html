<main>
  <p>
    Projects operating under the <code>w3c</code> organisation (or related to W3C even if under
    other umbrellas) are encouraged to specify a <code>w3c.json</code> file at the root of their
    repository. The purpose of this file is to provide some metadata about repositories so that
    they can be processed automatically by a variety of tools layered atop the organisation.
    They can also help humans figure out who to contact for a given problem.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here is an example:
  </p>
  <pre>{
    "group":     40318
,   "contacts":  ["darobin", "sideshowbarker"]
,   "repo-type": "rec-track"
}</pre>
  <p>
    The fields that are understood at this point are:
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt id="group"><code>group</code></dt>
    <dd>
      The numeric ID of the group in charge of this repo. While it is
      inconvenient for humans to find such IDs they are the best thing
      we have to programmatically create links between repositories
      and a whole lot of other data we have that are using this type
      of identifier.
      <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Note:</strong> If the group is actually a joint task
      force of more than group, please specify all the IDs of the
      groups consist of the task force as an array, e.g.:
      <br />
      <pre>"group": [35422, 83907]</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt id="contacts"><code>contacts</code></dt>
    <dd>
      An array of people who are considered points of contact for the
      repository for administrative requests. They aren't necessarily
      the primary contributor and they aren't necessarily from the W3C
      Team. Whatever works for any given repository is acceptable.
      For integration purposes, please use your <em>GitHub</em> ID.
    </dd>

    <dt id="repo-type"><code>repo-type</code></dt>
    <dd>
    String to identify the type and purpose of the repository, or an array of such strings if the repository holds more than one type of content.
    The possible values for this field are:<br/><br/>
    <dl>
      <dt>rec-track</dt>
      <dd>W3C Recommendation Track Documents including First Public
      Working Draft, Working Draft, Candidate Recommendation, Proposed
      Recommendation and W3C Recommendation</dd>

      <dt>note</dt>
      <dd>W3C Group Note including Working Group Note and Interest Group Note</dd>

      <dt>cg-report</dt>
      <dd>W3C Community Group Report</dd>

      <dt>process</dt>
      <dd>Discussion on the W3C Process document</dd>

      <dt>homepage</dt>
      <dd>Groups' homepages</dd>

      <dt>article</dt>
      <dd>Non-spec documents</dd>

      <dt>tool</dt>
      <dd>Development of tools</dd>

      <dt>project</dt>
      <dd>Group-independent projects</dd>

      <dt>others</dt>
      <dd>Other purposes</dd>
    </dl>
    </dd>

    <dt id="policy"><code>policy</code></dt>
    <dd>
      This is essentially a W3C-internal flag. If set to <code>open</code>, any W3C Team member
      should feel empowered to help with the management of this given repository. This can be
      set to <code>restricted</code> to indicate that for whatever reason, it is preferable to
      let the repository be handled only by team contacts directly associated with it. The
      default value is <code>open</code>.
