# Guide

The repository for "[The Art of Consensus](https://www.w3.org/Guide/)", W3C's Chair's Guidebook.

Documentation on how to participate in W3C WGs is split between multiple wikipages, github repos and emails. This means new members find difficulty in finding information as to how to participate and maybe give up trying. This repository is the place to pull all of those
together.

### How to edit

Pull requests are welcome from the Community. This Guide is for you after all.

The general edition of the Guidebook is managed by [@w3c/guidebook](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/teams/guidebook) but many areas are maintained by separate individuals or teams (check out the commits history of a file to see who).
