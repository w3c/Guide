<h1>How to do Wide Review</h1>
<p>Getting <i class="term">early</i> and <i class="term">wide</i> review of a document is very important, yet in practice it can be challenging.  This document provides some best practices for getting document review; it does not define explicit mandatory steps.</p>
<p>This page is linked to from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/">The Guide</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#wide-review">Wide Review</a> section in the W3C Process document.</p>
<p><strong>Feedback on this document is welcome, preferably by <a href="https://github.com/w3c/documentreview/issues">raising an issue</a> or a pull request.</strong></p>

  <h2>When should wide review be requested?</h2>
  <p>A document is available for review from the moment it is first <a
  href='https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#publishing'>published</a>.
  Working Groups should <a
  href='https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#formally-addressed'>formally
  address</a> any substantive review comment about a technical report in a
  timely manner.</p>
  <p>Wide review should or must be requested:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>After a <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#first-wd">First
  Public Working Draft</a> is published (for most documents).
  <p>Working Groups are often reluctant to make substantive changes to a mature
  document, so reviewers should get a chance to send substantive technical
  reviews as early as possible. This is especially important for <a
  href="#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal reviews</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Before a document gets advanced to <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#transition-cr">Candidate
  Recommendation</a> or gets updated as a <a
  href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#update-requests">Candidate
  Recommendation Snapshot</a>.
  <p>For those, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/policies/process/">W3C
  Process</a> requires a Group to show that the specification has received wide
  review.</p>
  </li>
  <li>When a document is both reasonably stable and still flexible enough to
  allow changes where issues are identified.</li>
  <li>When new features are added after a document has already received wide
  review (perhaps requesting a review limited to the new features).</li>
  </ul>
  </section>

<section id="who_to_ask_for_review">
<h2>Who to ask for wide review?</h2>

 <p>The objective is to ensure that the entire set of stakeholders of the Web
 community, including the general public, have  adequate notice of the progress
 of the Working Group and are genuinely able to perform reviews of and provide
 comments on the specification. When considering <a
 href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions">requests to advance the maturity
 level of the document</a>, the Team will consider who has been explicitly
 offered a reasonable opportunity to review the document.</p>

<p>You <strong>must</strong> publish an updated technical report, with the Status of the Document
indicating clearly that you're looking for <em>wide review</em>, before inviting
review from other stakeholders. Our <a
href='https://github.com/w3c/transition-notifier/blob/main/notify.js'>tooling</a>
monitors publications and propagates notifications to <a
href="mailto:public-review-announce@w3.org">public-review-announce@w3.org</a>
automatically (for example, <a
href='https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-review-announce/2021Jun/0008.html'>Candidate
Recommendation Snapshot: Payment Request API (Call for Wide Review)</a>).</p>

<p>You should then inform, and request reviews from:</p>

<ul>
<li>the groups listed in the WG's charter, especially those who manage
dependencies.</li>
<li>the groups jointly responsible for a particular document (if any).</li>
<li>the <a href='/Guide/process/horizontal-groups.html'>horizontal groups</a>
using the <a href="#how_to_get_horizontal_review">method described below</a>.
<em>Note that sending an email to the public-review-announce list alone is not
sufficient to trigger horizontal reviews. You will still need to formally
request review from the Horizontal Groups, as described below</em></li>
<li>the general public,  including Web developers, technology providers and
implementers, application developers, etc. Consider:
  <ul>
    <li>sending a dedicated announcement to <a
    href="mailto:public-review-announce@w3.org">public-review-announce@w3.org</a>
    if needed (in case the default notice sent to that list is not enough).</li>
    <li>using blog posts, social media, or other ways of alerting the public to
    your document and requesting feedback.</li>
  </ul>
</li>

<li>other groups, at your discretion, even if not in the WG charter, such as
other W3C groups, external organizations and SSOs  working on related areas,
etc.</li>

</ul>

<aside id='using_github_issue'>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> consider tracking your wide review progress using a
GitHub issue, such as <a href="https://github.com/w3c/sensors/issues/299">issue
#299 of the Sensors API</a>. You can then simply point the Team to the
issue.</p>

<details id="githubissue" hidden>
  <summary>Generate a meta-issue to track wide review steps in a GitHub repository</summary>
  <p>You may find it useful to create an issue in the GitHub repository of your spec to track your progress. Add the name of your GitHub repository to the field below and hit the "Create GitHub issue" button. This opens the "new issue" form in your repository, and pre-fills the body with review steps as a list of checkboxes.</p>
  <p>
    <label for="repository">GitHub repository where issue should be created (format: <code>owner/repo</code>):</label>
    <br/><input type="text" name="repository" id="repository" placeholder="Repo name, e.g. w3c/documentreview">
    <br/><button>Create GitHub issue</button>
  </p>
  <p>Note: You will be able to edit the issue's title and body before it gets created.</p>
</details>
</aside>

<p>The reviews provided by the <a href='/Guide/process/horizontal-groups.html'>horizontal
groups</a>, a subset of a full wide review, do receive special attention and
much of the rest of this document focuses on how and when to conduct horizontal
reviews.</p>

</section>

<section id="how_to_get_horizontal_review">
<h2>How to get horizontal review</h2>
<p>When you have published a First Public Working Draft, you should work through available "self-review" materials and request review of your results in at least the following areas. <em>Long enough</em> before you request a transition to CR, you should do the same again, identifying substantive specification changes since the first review. </p><p>The meaning of "Long enough" depends on how many changes there are, how clearly you have explained them, and how much discussion is needed to resolve issues. Pointing to 14 concise points for a small spec means a short time if they are simple fixes, pointing to 900 diffs from commits and hoping people understand them in a 300 page spec means it will take a <strong>long</strong> time to get review, and potentially a long time to also discuss and agree on how to solve the issues. If you have effectively identified issues for review during development and received feedback on them, the review time will probably be shorter. Horizontal review groups sometimes get bogged down; planning in advance is useful.</p>

<p>You should familiarize yourself with the rest of this document. This section is just a quick reminder for when you are in the middle of doing the work.</p>
<p>Recognize that horizontal review groups may be resource limited and may only be able to do one review or may have difficulty scheduling your review quickly.  Give them as much time as you can, consistent with asking for review while it is still reasonable to change the technology to accommodate the issues they find.</p>
</section>

<section id="working_with_horizontal_review_labels">
<h2><a href="#working_with_horizontal_review_labels">Working with Horizontal Review labels</a></h2>

<p>Applying these labels doesn't replace the need to schedule a review of your spec at an appropriate time. (See <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">How to Get Horizontal Review</a> above.) Horizontal groups participants can find <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://w3c.github.io/horizontal-issue-tracker/HOWTO">detailed process information here</a>.
</p>

<section id="day-to-day_use_of_labels">
<h3>Day-to-day use of labels</h3>
<p>Apply the <span class="githublabel">*-tracker</span> label in your own repository to draw a horizontal review group’s attention to an issue in one of your own repositories. Horizontal review groups may also apply the label if they are interested in tracking a particular issue.  Tooling will automatically notify the horizontal group that you attached the label.
</p><p>If you want some specific advice from the horizontal group, describe that request in the issue thread.
</p><p>Horizontal review groups may apply the <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span> label to issues they expect to be resolved before the specification moves to a new maturity level. Working Groups must not remove or add this label (not even when you close your issue).
</p><p>If the <a href='/Guide/process/horizontal-groups.html'>horizontal group</a> believes that an issue with a <span class="githublabel">*-tracker</span> label needs to be resolved before a transition, they may apply a <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span> label to the issue. Automatic tooling will later remove the <span class="githublabel">*-tracker</span> label.</p>
 <p>If you close an issue with a <span class="githublabel">*-tracker</span> or <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span> label attached, do not remove the label.  Keeping the label maintains the tracking if the issue is reopened, but also provides potentially useful information about what was tracked. (Closed issues in your repository have no effect on tools that check for unresolved issues.)</p>
 <p>At the end of a review, and before attempting to transition the spec, you should clarify that a resolution is described for all of the issues with a <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span> label, and check that the horizontal group is aware of those resolutions. You don't have to do this for issues with the <span class="githublabel">*-tracker</span> label. (The horizontal group was only tracking those issues, not expecting a particular resolution.)</p>
 <p>Note that the label may be applied by setting it directly on the issue if you have proper rights, or by appending it preceded with a PLUS sign (+) in the issue description, +<i class="term">*-tracker</i> or +<i class="term">*-needs-resolution</i>.</p>
</section>

<section id="horizontal-needs-resolution-transitions">
	<h3>What happens with *-needs-resolution issues at transition?</h3>
	
	<p>When a Working Group requests a new Maturity level, the transition <strong>will not be approved</strong> if a horizontal group has an open *-needs-resolution issue showing on the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/PM/horizontal/">tracker boards</a>. Note that the tracker monitors the horizontal group's <em>copy</em> of the issue. Before requesting a new Maturity level, the Working Group is advised to review the tracker and contact the horizontal group to close any lingering issues.</p>
	
</section>


<section id="What_happens_to_unresolved_issues_marked_needs-resolution">

<h3>What happens to unresolved issues marked <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span>?</h3>

<p>As lead technical architect, the W3C Council is tasked (among many things) to assess consensus within W3C for architectural issues and to decide on the outcome of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.w3.org/2019/Process-20190301/#FormalObjection">Formal Objections</a>. When a horizontal issue gets flagged as *-needs-resolution and a Group chooses to request a new Maturity level despite the lack of consensus with the horizontal group, it is the task of the W3C Team to assess the issue and the outcome of the request. A horizontal group MAY choose to elevate an horizontal issue as a Formal Objection to elevate further the importance of an issue per the W3C Process.
</p><p>In the case where an horizontal issue hasn’t been addressed and the document was allowed to move forward, it is recommended that the issue remains open in the horizontal group repository (it MAY get closed in the specification repository unless the W3C Team requests otherwise). Some issues may take years to get resolved, but that doesn’t mean those should be forgotten.</p>

<dd>
<ul>
 <li>A: It is <strong>strongly encouraged</strong> but not required.  Resolving security and privacy issues can require significant changes in specs, so it helps to identify them early.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>A: Yes, since Process-2019.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Q: How does a group prove its documents have had wide review before proceeding to CR?</dt>
<dd><ul><li>A: Requests to the horizontal review groups will appear in Github, as above. </li>
<li>A: Keep a Disposition of Comments (DoC) Document showing comments received and a summary of their resolution.</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Q: Is there such a thing as too many reviews?</dt>
<dd><ul><li>A: Not really</li></ul></dd>

<dt>Q: Is it possible to make too many requests for review?</dt>
<dd><ul><li> A: Yes.  To help the review groups, only request updated reviews when substantive changes have been made, and clearly identify the changes since the last review.</li>
<li> A: This is also the reason that the Process clearly suggests there should be (TR) Working Drafts published when there are "significant changes that would benefit from review beyond the Working Group", rather than every day or only twice in the life of a spec…</li>
<li> A: TR Working Drafts are also useful for reviews since they provide a dated snapshot which can be recovered when the review comments are being discussed. Trying to discuss review comments against a document which has changed out of all recognition can be a frustrating and inefficient experience.</li></ul></dd>

<section id="common_mistakes">
 <h2><a href="#common_mistakes">Common mistakes when making a transition request</a></h2>
 <ol>
  <li><p>If you make substantive changes, you'll need to do a wide review for those 
   before you move forward to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#who_to_ask_for_review">next maturity stage</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Never ever exclude some <a href='/Guide/process/horizontal-groups.html'>horizontal groups</a> from your review requests 
   because you concluded it was irrelevant for them or they haven't responded to your last request.</p>
   <p>Let them make the decision that something is irrelevant to their field of expertise instead.
   You're welcome to time out if you don't hear back, and request to move forward anyway.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Publish a Working Draft or a Candidate Recommendation Draft when asking for reviews. </p>
   <p>It's better for a Group to miss the fact that you fixed an issue in your editor's draft 
    than the Team missing the fact you made an unreviewed substantive change in your editor's draft.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>Don't flag your issues with one of those 
    <span class="githublabel">*-needs-resolution</span> labels,
   and don't remove one which has been applied (you <em>can</em> close the issue though, if it is resolved).</p>
   <p>Those are intended solely to be used by <a href='/Guide/process/horizontal-groups.html'>horizontal groups</a> to 
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#What_happens_to_unresolved_issues_marked_needs-resolution">bring special attention</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don't assume that the horizontal group will be able to 
      schedule and complete a review within 2 weeks so that you can proceed to CR.</p>
    <p>They may not even be able to find someone with availability to do the review in that time, 
      and then they need a week or two to discuss their response after the review, 
      and then they'll send you comments that may require you to make substantive changes.</p>
