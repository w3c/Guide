title: Continuity of Operations under Travel Restrictions
toc: true
---

## Status {#status}

This is an evolving document, started in February 2020. Comments may be made in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/w3c/guide/issues).

## Purpose {#purpose}

With travel restrictions, the world relies even more on online communication/interaction and the World Wide Web is a crucial part of society.

This document outlines plans to continue W3C activities while travel restrictions and isolation protocols limit the ability of W3C community members to participate in-person in W3C meetings, [including the W3C Staff](https://www.w3.org/news/2020/w3c-team-interim-travel-restrictions-and-guidance-for-continuity-of-operations/).

## Addressing the needs of your participants first {#people}

First and foremost, group chairs should make room for people to acknowledge new challenges. Everyone is coping with the crisis differently and with different work, living or family conditions. It's important in those times to give individuals time and space and to ensure that their care and safety come first.

The W3C [Code of Conduct](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/) applies to all W3C meetings, whether they are in-person, virtual, or hybrid.

## General policy for meetings {#policy}

Meeting face-to-face is an important component of the work for some of our groups. Meetings enable group chairs to:

1. Set an alternative dynamic compared to interactions by email/GitHub or during teleconferences;
1. Focus synchronously on a set of issues and goals and reduce distractions;
1. Bring to closure hard issues in case they languish due to lack of consensus.

We recommend that all groups that consider holding physical face-to-face meetings take into account the needs of all group participants, by seeking for **everyone to interact on an equal basis with other participants in remote locations**. Group Chairs should not have or set the expectation that group participants will travel. This includes complementing in-person meetings with virtual accommodations, rather than simply canceling in-person meetings, to the extent that these are respectful of the individual needs.

## Meeting purposes {#types}

We encounter several types of in-person meetings at W3C:

- Group face-to-face meetings;
- Workshops;
- Plenary meetings;
- Advisory Committee meetings.

Virtual presence meetings can take several forms, some better suited to the meeting purpose than others. Refer to the section [Meeting Formats](#sessions) below for examples.

## Accommodationss for virtual presence {#virtualPresence}

Hybrid meetings occur when all or some of the participants are attending remotely; virtual meetings occur when all participatns are attending remotely. All participants should realize that when people pivot to new environments new issues can arise, including [accessibility](#accessibility) and separation from one's usual work place. Meeting chairs should leave space for the participants to talk about this.

**Video conferencing** - Groups should plan to make extensive use of
video conferencing services for those unable to travel. In the case of
travel restrictions for some but not all participants, some
participants may wish to gather in hubs (if allowed by local
authorities). When such gatherings occur, a local facilitator at each
hub should assure equitable participation by all through good
communication and participation practices; e.g., no "side
conversations" even if muted. Every effort must be made to put all the
meeting participants on equal terms whether they are at a hub or
participating outside of a hub.
{:#videoconferencing}

**Scheduling** - Groups should give consideration to scheduling their
meeting(s) in a timezone that works for the majority of the attendees.
As participants will be working in their local timezones, what is
"workable" will vary with individual circumstances, including
sensitivity to work-from-home environments and non-participant
colleagues who may not be aware that the participant is "away" even if
they are physically in their office.
{:#scheduling}

Meeting duration should be limited to 4 hours per day; consider two 90-minute segments with an hour break between them.  That break can be used by the participants for "hallway" conversations, arranged on separate conference channels.

**Materials** - Presenters are even more strongly encouraged to
distribute (post to the web) presentation materials in advance of the
meeting to avoid participants using extra download bandwidth during
the meeting. Presentation materials must be available in accessible
formats that meet [WCAG 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&levels=aaa).
If it is not possible to provide a structured document within a
videoconference presentation window, provide an accessible source file
on the web.
{:#materials}

**Video** - Video cameras are **strongly** encouraged; this improves
the sense of being together.  Groups may prefer to use
teleconferencing services that allow each participant to choose not to
receive video streams if their network becomes saturated. However, any
discussion content that is shared via video, including screen sharing,
must be made [accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/) by
some means to those who cannot -- or choose not to -- use the video
feed. As always, do not make video recordings or screen captures
without the [explicit consent of the
participants](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).
{:#video}

**Screen sharing** - While screen sharing can be an effective way to
work together, it also causes accessibility problems since it
prohibits the use of screen readers and translation services. A best
practice is to post accessible materials on the web and share links
instead of just showing a picture of it.
{:#screen-sharing}

**Accessibility** - In all cases W3C wants to make sure that people
with accessibility needs can participate. Meeting organizers must
consider how best to accomplish that with what is currently available;
e.g., is captioning or interpretation needed? Are meeting organizers
aware of any potential interoperability issues between the
videoconferencing platform and individuals' assistive technologies?
Ensure that virtual meetings are accessible for all participants using
resources including [making audio and video media
accessible](https://www.w3.org/WAI/media/av/) and [how to meet WCAG 2,
a quick reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/quickref/).
{:#accessibility}

**Testing** - Participants should be offered testing opportunities to
assure their local equipment is operational and their bandwidth
adequate. Participants should test their camera as well as the quality
of their audio. During testing solicit feedback from others on the
quality of each.

### Selecting a video conferencing service {#selectingvideoconferencing}

The considerations for a video conferencing service include:

- ability for a participant to turn off incoming video (see network bandwidth)
- accessibility
- audio quality and settings
- cost
- dial-in capability
- internationalization
- interoperable browser support
- network bandwidth
- native platform independence (a native app that works on Linux, Mac, Windows, …)
- privacy
- queue management
- reliability
- scalability
- screen and application sharing (share only one app, not only entire screen)
- security
- video quality and settings

W3C uses Zoom services and groups may use those with assistance from the W3C Team. See also our [zoom page](zoom.md) for additional information.

## W3C Workshops {#workshops}

We continue to conduct fully distributed [workshops](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#GAEvents) with virtual presence sessions. We are adapting the existing model (program committee issues call for participation and invites presentations based on submitted position statements) and experiment with new models. In any format, materials should be posted and archived accessibly. Participants should be notified of plans for audio/video recording and confidentiality level.

Workshops are often key gathering spots for consideration of new ideas, with a mix of prepared presentation, pre-determined or self-organizing breakout sessions, and the all-important "hallway track" opportunity for side conversations. Organizers are encouraged to replicate this mix in virtual meetings. Some proposals include:

- Plenary-style presentations: one or a few people present to the group and take questions.
- Distributed breakouts: break into parallel channels with distinct videoconference lines (or zoom's "breakout" feature) and report back.
- Lightning talks: invite attendees to give short (3-min) video presentations introducing themselves. These may be topical or highlight a side interest.
- Open mic breaks: leave the videoconference bridge open during breaks, and encourage attendees to chat and start side channels to continue discussions of shared interest.
- … additional suggestions welcome to the Strategy team.

## W3C AC Meetings {#ac_meeting}

The Advisory Committee meeting has provided for remote participation for many years.  We have [announced](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/w3c-ac-members/2022JanMar/0039.html) (member link) that the [April 2022 AC meeting](https://www.w3.org/2022/04/AC/) will be fully distributed; with an administrative meeting "host" tasked to identify all participants in both IRC and the teleconferencing service and assure that all audio channels other than the Chair and presenter are muted when not in active conversation.

Presenters will be expected to pre-record their presentations and meeting attendees will be expected to prepare for the meeting by viewing those recordings. W3C staff will provide assistance in making the recordings and will arrange to have captions added and translated to other languages.

Each presentation will be accompanied by a WBS form for submitting questions and comments in advance.

As is our standard practice, the presentation slides should also be posted in the web to allow the meeting participants to quickly cite and call up a specific slide. These slides should be posted in the web at the same time the recording is posted. The captioning should add "\[next slide]" text to allow use of assistive technology with the posted slides in combination with the recorded captions.

Given pre-recorded presentations, the bulk of the synchronous meeting time should be devoted to Q&A. The presenter may do a brief (~3 minute) recap of the material that was presented via recording but should present only a single slide on which the discussion points are all summarized. The presenter should use the WBS input to inform this recap and to address questions and comments that were submitted in advance.

High quality real-time captioning of the meeting should be provided in more than one language.

We will use IRC as the default mode of hand-raising and discussion. If you have difficulty accessing IRC, for instance due to network firewalls or assistive technology reasons, please let us know the reason in advance in case we are able to address it or otherwise provide an alternative.

Special guests are still welcome in the meeting, upon approval of the Chair of the Advisory Committee meeting. Recordings *may* be available for a limited time for special guests.

## Meeting formats {#sessions}

Agenda items during virtual presence meetings could take several of the following forms. The following sections propose some suggested alternatives to in-person meetings.

For all forms of sessions the Chairs should also allow asynchronous feedback and discussions, using GitHub issues, emails, or other forms of input before and after a virtual presence meeting, or between days in the case of a multi-day meeting.

### Primarily discussion sessions {#discussionSessions}

Intended for agenda items requiring only discussions (such as specification issues or panels). Those should be replaced by dedicated discussion with virtual presence, possibly clustered.

### Presentation + discussion sessions {#presentationSessions}

Intended for agenda items requiring a presentation first, followed by a discussion (such as technical proposals or position papers). Those *should* be replaced by pre-recording the presentation(s) with slides at least 24 hours before the discussion (to avoid burden on non-timezone friendly participants). Then, the participants can have one or more dedicated discussion with virtual presence.

### Update sessions {#updateSessions}

Intended for agenda items to update the participants on specific items (such as implementation reports or editor updates). Those **should** be replaced by pre-recording the presentation(s) with slides, with possibly *one* teleconference to allow for questions, clustering the updates together. You *MAY* however differ those sessions depending on the important of the topic.
