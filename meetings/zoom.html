      <p>
        W3C has a Zoom account and
        W3C Groups may use those with assistance from the W3C Team (for Community Groups, see
        the separate <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/about/tool/">Tools and Infrastructure</a>).
        We are aware of questions about Zoom's security and privacy
	practices and recommend <a href="#settings">mitigations</a>
	and usage guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2 id='scheduling'>Scheduling a Zoom Conference</h2>

      <p>
	W3C's groups typically meet weekly and therefore schedule recurring
	meetings for the duration of their charters.
        The Zoom scheduler limits how far into the future a recurring meeting may be scheduled. However, you can
        extend the end date after some time has passed.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have found that recurring meetings can be used at any time and are not limited to the scheduled period. Thus, ad-hoc sessions and regular
        meetings that are scheduled for different times to use the same meeting number/URI.
      </p>

      <p>
	To avoid interference from non-invitees, meeting coordinates
	should not be posted publicly.  The meeting information,
	including password, should be posted to a Member-only mailing
	list and only the URI of the list archive message used in
	public meeting agendas or other public group pages.
      </p>

      <h2 id='settings'>Suggested Settings</h2>

      <p>
        W3C Team account owners should set <a href='https://w3c.zoom.us/profile/setting'>account default settings</a> as follows:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Join before host [on]</li>
	<li>Waiting room [off] (off is the default; if turned on for a meeting, "Join before host" is disabled for that meeting</li>
        <li>Feedback to Zoom [off]</li>
        <li>Display end-of-meeting experience feedback survey [off]</li>
        <li>Whiteboard [on]</li>
        <li>Show a "Join from your browser" link [on]</li>
        <li>When attendees join meeting before host [off]</li>
        <li><a href='transcipts.html'>Save Captions</a> [off].</li>
	<li>Attention tracking [off] (<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/">Zoom says they have removed attention tracking as of 1 April 2020</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
	These settings will allow the group to meet even if the Team
	Host is not present.  If an actual Host is required, the Team
	Host can join the call momentarily and assign co-Host privileges
	to one or more of the other attendees.
      </p>

      <h2 id='testing'>Testing Your Connection</h2>

      <p>
        Zoom offers a <a href='https://zoom.us/test'>test meeting service</a> for anyone to use to test their connection.
        You should use it to hear how your
        own audio is working. This service may only work for Internet (not phone) connections. See also <a
        href='https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115002262083-Joining-a-test-meeting'>Zoom's
        article on testing</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id='recordings'>Recordings</h2>

      <p>
        Zoom provides the ability to make recordings.  If this
	feature is used, it must be with the consent of the meeting
	participants. Chairs have the responsibility to ensure that
	participants are aware that they are being recorded whenever
	this feature is used.
	Recordings are made available after the end (could take a
	few hours) using an email notification to the meeting host,
	and can only be shared by default to individuals with a W3C Zoom
	account. We're looking into providing additional
	recommendations to make those videos available through other
      means.
      </p>
      <p>
        Check also the special guidance on <a href="transcripts.html">automated meeting transcripts</a>.
      </p>

      <h2 id='ending'>Ending a Meeting</h2>

      <p>
	Participants sometimes wander off and forget to disconnect
	at the end of a meeting.  To avoid later embarrassment it
	is recommended that someone with Host privileges explicitly
	end each Zoom meeting once it has adjourned.
      </p>


      <h2 id='considerations'>Considerations</h2>

      <h3 id="sec_privacy">Security and Privacy</h3>

      <p>
            The
            standard precautions apply for meeting participants to mute
            your audio except when you mean to talk to the meeting to
            avoid interference and accidentally sharing private
            communications (e.g. yelling at your pets), and also to pay
            attention to what is visible in your video feed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides the <a href='#settings'>suggested settings for the W3C team accounts</a>, we understand that
        concerns have been raised regarding the security/privacy of the Zoom clients. Several of the issues reported
        were based on native application hacks with computers already infected (such as modifying the installation script).
        The best and most cost-effective way to prevent those issues is to use the Web application for Zoom but it is
        more CPU intensive. Using an alternative device helps in isolating the native applications
        or the impact on CPU usage from the Web application. It's the perfect opportunity to repurpose an old device.
      </p>
