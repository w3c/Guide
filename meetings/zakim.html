<p>The Zakim IRC "bot" is a Semantic Web agent ("swagent") that helps
facilitate meetings using IRC <del>in conjunction with the W3C's Zakim audio
teleconference bridge</del>.</p>
<!-- (See also the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/1998/12/bridge/Zakim.html">Zakim Bridge Status
Monitor</a> and the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Guide/1998/08/teleconference-calendar">W3C
Teleconference Schedule</a>.)  -->

<p>It is generally available on W3C's IRC server,
under the "Zakim" nickname. <del>It gives information about teleconferences
available on the bridge, such as the names of the conferences available at
that time, the attendance list, and the possibility to associate telephone numbers with
people. When someone joins a conference, she/he will be announced to the channel using the
+xxx convention, where xxx can be a name, an anonymized phone number or a
generated ID for numbers that do not have callerID information. When someone
leaves, -xxx will be used, following the same convention.</del></p>

<p>In the following command descriptions, optional words in commands are indicated in square brackets.  "please" can
be abbreviated to "pls" if you wish to be polite yet still save keystrokes. 
("please" is also accepted at the end of all commands.)</p>


<h2 id="invite">Bringing Zakim into your meeting channel</h2>

<p>The command:</p>
<p class="command"><kbd>/invite Zakim &lt;channel&gt;</kbd></p>
<p>will bring Zakim on to your IRC channel.</p>

<pre class="example"><samp>/invite zakim &amp;test
[16:41] *** Zakim (~rrs-bridg@tux.w3.org) has joined &amp;test</samp></pre>

<p>Some irc clients let you omit the channel name and will fill in the name
of current channel.  This is a feature of the irc client, not of Zakim.</p>

<p>You might also want
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent">RRSAgent</a>
in your meeting channel to keep a record of the meeting in W3C Web space.
To start logging the channel, invite the RRSAgent bot as follows:</p>

<p class="command"><kbd>/invite rrsagent &lt;channel&gt;</kbd></p>

<p>You can find the URL for the log being written by RRSAgent by typing
the command:</p>

<p class="command"><kbd>rrsagent, bookmark</kbd></p>

<h2 id="addressing">Talking to Zakim</h2>

<p>Once Zakim is on your IRC channel, all commands to Zakim begin with</p>

<p class="command"><kbd>Zakim,</kbd></p>

<p>Zakim's commands are not case sensitive, but, in general, must be
grammatically correct.</p>

<p>Zakim will respond to normal irc lines and to <kbd>ACTION</kbd> lines
(typically entered with the '/me' command in many irc clients).
The '/me' form is especially recommended for avoiding clutter
in <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent">RRSAgent</a>
logs; interactions that serve no useful purpose in the 
permanent irc record can be prefixed with '/me'.  This typically
includes 'q+'
and 'ack' commands; e.g. 'q+' will be logged by RRSAgent whereas
'/me q+' will not [see <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent#stop"
>RRSAgent log recording</a>].  Zakim will generally mimic the same usage
in the reply.  For the commands such as 'agenda?' to which Zakim will
respond without being directly addressed, Zakim responds directly
if he is addressed and in third-person ('/me') form if he was not
addressed.</p>

<a id="identifying"></a>
<h2 id="info">Identifying your particular teleconference</h2>


<!--
<h3>List all conferences presently active on the Zakim bridge</h3>

<p>In order to have Zakim report relevant events, you must inform him which
teleconference is yours. Helpful commands include:</p>


<ul class="command">
<li>  <kbd>[please] list [conferences]</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>what conferences do you see?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>what conferences are active?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>what conferences?</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p class="def">
    Conferences that are in the schedule for the present time but not
    yet active are also listed.</p>

<pre class="example">[16:42] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, list conferences 
[16:42] &lt;Zakim&gt; I see Longfellow II</pre>

<h3>Associate the current IRC channel with &lt;conf name&gt;</h3>

<ul class="command"><li>  <kbd>this [conference] is &lt;conf name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>move &lt;conf name&gt; to here</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>move &lt;conf name&gt; to this channel</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p> Once you
      have identified your conference name, Zakim will announce new participants and departing participants.  The name you
      enter must match the name or conference code of a conference
      that is already in progress.
      You need not enter the entire conference name; any part of the name
      that uniquely identifies it is sufficient.  The first form works
      only when the conference is not already associated with an IRC
      channel.  The last two forms will move a conference away from
      another IRC channel if necessary, informing the previous channel
      of the move.
</p>

<pre class="example">[16:43] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, this is longfello
[16:43] &lt;Zakim&gt; ok, Alan-MIT</pre>

<h3>Associate the current IRC channel with &lt;conf name&gt;</h3>

<p class="command"><kbd>this [conference] will be &lt;conf name&gt;</kbd></p>


<p>If your conference has not yet started use this command to inform
      Zakim of a soon-to-start conference.  Zakim will announce the start of the conference
      as well as the new participants.  The first conference, including any
      already in progress, whose name contains the specified &lt;conf
      name&gt; will be taken as the intended conference.  If &lt;conf
      name&gt; does not match any named conference a match will be attempted
      to the conference code of a scheduled conference.<p>
-->

<h3 id="startmeeting">Start a meeting</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li>  <kbd>start [the | this] meeting</kbd></li>
  <li>  <kbd>prepare [the | this] meeting</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Invite <a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent">RRSAgent</a> to the current channel, provide the expected access
control (visibility) of RRSAgent's records and a title for the
meeting.  Additional instructions may be pre-stored and entered into
  the irc log.</p>

<p>The two forms of this command do the same thing; some people set things up in the channel well before the meeting is scheduled to start and the 'prepare' synonym reduces confusion for others who are already on the channel.</p>

<h3 id="endmeeting">End a meeting</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li>  <kbd>end [the | this] meeting</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Displays a final list of those who were recognized as being present
during the meeting, requests 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2002/03/RRSAgent">RRSAgent</a> to
create the formatted meeting record, and then departs (see 'bye').</p>

<h3 id="description">Provide a description for the teleconference on the current IRC channel</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li>  <kbd>this [conference] is &lt;description&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p class="def">
  Stores &lt;description&gt; for later query.
</p>

<p>
  Teleconference participants appreciate having a simple way to retrieve a
  reminder of the teleconference coordinates; what number to dial or URL to
  access, what conference code to use, etc.  This command saves such information
  for later query.
</p>

<pre class="example">[16:43] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, this is WebEx 640 999 321
[16:43] &lt;Zakim&gt; ok, Alan-MIT</pre>


<h3 id="describe">Request the full name of the conference that is associated with the current IRC channel.</h3>
<ul class="command">
  <li>  <kbd>what conference is this?</kbd></li>
  <li>  <kbd>what is the conference code?</kbd></li>
  <li>  <kbd>what is the passcode?</kbd></li>
  <li>  <kbd>what's the conference code?</kbd></li>
  <li>  <kbd>what's the code?</kbd></li>
</ul>


<p>Returns the conference description that was previously entered.</p>

<h3 id="savedescription">Saving a conference description for future meetings</h3>

<p class="command"><kbd>save this conference description</kbd></p>

<p>If the conference description will apply to future teleconferences
  on this channel you may wish that Zakim save the information more
  permanently.  Zakim does not actually know when your teleconference
  has started or ended, however.  Descriptions previously entered will
  not be saved when Zakim restarts unless you use this command.</p>

<a id="attendance"></a>
<h2>Attendance reports</h2>

<h3 id="present">Announcing your presence</h3>

<p class="command"><kbd>present+ [&lt;name&gt;]</kbd></p>

<p class="def">Informs Zakim and all others present on the irc channel
  that you have joined the teleconference.  Recommended practice is to
  enter this after you confirm you hear audio from teleconference or
  when you enter the meeting room to which the conference is connected.</p>

<p>Zakim previously was able to announce the arrival of new teleconference
participants automatically.  This is no longer the case; you must now tell
Zakim that you have joined the teleconference.</p>

<p>If you omit &lt;name&gt; Zakim will use your irc nick.</p>

<p class="command"><kbd>present- [&lt;name&gt;]</kbd></p>

<p class="def">Informs Zakim and all others present on the irc channel
  that you have left the teleconference.</p>

<p>Good practice is to inform others when you leave or drop off the
  teleconference or leave the meeting room.</p>

<h3 id="whoshere">Produce a report of the current participants in your conference</h3>
<ul class="command"><li><kbd>who is here?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who's here?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who is on the phone?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who is on the call?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who's on the phone?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who's on the call?</kbd></li>

</ul>    

<pre class="example">[17:06] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, who's here?
[17:06] &lt;Zakim&gt; On the phone I see Dan, Alan
[17:06] &lt;Zakim&gt; On IRC I see Alan-MIT, gerald</pre>

<p>Note that Zakim reports both phone participants and irc participants.</p>

<!--
<h3>Produce a report of the current phone participants in your
      conference</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li>  <kbd>who is on the phone?</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Zakim will report only the phone participants.</p>

<p>The word 'still' may also be included, as in 'who is still
      on the phone?'</p>
-->

<h3 id="listparticipants">Produce a report of the names of all participants</h3>

<ul class="command">
<li><kbd>list attendees</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>list participants</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>The report will show participants who are currently in your conference or who had been in the conference earlier and have since departed.</p>

<!--
<h3>Report whether &lt;name&gt; is present in some active
    conference</h3>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>is &lt;name&gt; here?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>is &lt;name&gt; on the call?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>[have you] seen &lt;name&gt;?</kbd></li>
</ul>

<h3>Identify Group of people</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;name&gt; has &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt; ...]</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; holds &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt; ...]</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; contains &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt; ...]</kbd></li>
</ul>    
<p>Informs Zakim that the participant identified as &lt;name&gt; is a
      group of people whose name(s) are &lt;n1&gt;, &lt;n2&gt;, etc.  This is
      useful in the case of a conference room phone around which many people
      might be sitting.  Zakim will include these names in the list of
      attendees that he reports when the conference terminates and
      in response to the 'list attendees' command.</p>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>&lt;n1&gt; is with &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Like the commands above, this informs Zakim that the participant
      identified as &lt;name&gt; is a group of people whose names are
      &lt;name&gt; and &lt;n1&gt;.  This is normally used when a pair of
      people are using a conference room.  Zakim will include both names
      in the list of attendees that it reports when the conference
      terminates.</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;name&gt; [has] [just] arrived in &lt;name2&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; [has] [just] entered &lt;name2&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; is in &lt;name2&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name2&gt; [now] also has &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name2&gt; [now] also holds &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name2&gt; [now] also contains &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li></ul>
    
<p>Informs Zakim that another participant should be added to the group
      identified by &lt;name2&gt;.</p>


<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>&lt;name&gt; [has] [just] left &lt;name2&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; [has] [just] departed &lt;name2&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Informs Zakim that the group identified by &lt;name2&gt; no longer
      contains the participant &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;name&gt; no longer has &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt; ...]</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; no longer holds &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt;  ...]</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;name&gt; no longer contains &lt;n1&gt;[, &lt;n2&gt;  ...]</kbd></li>
</ul>
   
<p>Informs Zakim that the group identified by &lt;name&gt; no longer
      contains the participant(s) &lt;n1&gt;, etc.</p>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>who is in &lt;name&gt;?</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Reports the parties thought to be present in the group identified by
      &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<a id="callers"></a>
<h2>Identifying participants</h2>

<p>Once you have informed Zakim of your teleconference, he will report the
comings and goings of participants. New arrivals are announced to the channel
using the +xxx convention, and departures as -xxx. There are several ways
in which conferees are identified:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The conferee was called by the Zakim bridge, (staff only). The caller
    will be identified by name.</li>
  <li>The conferee called in on a line which supplied the caller's telephone
    number (CallerID) and that number was known to Zakim. The caller will be
    identified by name. </li>
  <li>The conferee called in on a line which supplied the caller's telephone
    number (CallerID) and that number was NOT known to Zakim. The caller will
    be identified by an anonymized version of the calling number.   Note
    that you can <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/1998/12/bridge/info/name.php3">supply your
    information</a> to be added to the W3C bridge monitor database to
    help Zakim recognize you in the future.</li>
  <li>The conferee called in on a line which did NOT supply the caller's
    telephone number. The caller will be identified as "??Pnn" where "nn" is
    the port on the Zakim bridge used by the caller.</li>
  <li><em>experimental feature</em>: The conferee entered an individual
    identifier via the telephone keypad after joining the conference;
    <strong>43<em>nnn</em>#</strong>.  ('43' corresponds to 'ID' on
    the <a href="/Guide/1998/08/phone">keypad</a>.)</li>
  <li>Zakim was unable to determine any information about the caller. In that
    case the caller will be identifed by a generated 2 to 4 character
    sequence, "??zzz".</li>
</ol>

<p>You can help Zakim identify callers by name using the following
commands:</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is perhaps &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is possibly &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is probably &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; may be &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li></ul>

    <p>Supplants &lt;old identifier&gt; with &lt;name&gt;, adding the
      <em>maybe</em> flag. This means that this association is not certain
      and will not be saved for future references. Such callers are
      identified in lists with a "?". Future rejoin from the same number will
      show "+xxx is perhaps yyy".</p>

<pre class="example">[17:07] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, ??P1 may be Foo
[17:07] &lt;Zakim&gt; +Foo?; got it
[17:09] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, who's here?
[17:09] &lt;Zakim&gt; I see Foo?, Alan</pre>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is &lt;name&gt;</kbd>
</li></ul>    


<p>Supplants &lt;old identifier&gt; with &lt;name&gt;.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:13] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, ??P0 is AlanK
[17:13] &lt;Zakim&gt; +AlanK; got it</pre>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;old name&gt; is really &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li></ul>
    
<p>This command reassigns names, and removes any <em>maybe</em> flag if
      one was present.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:10] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, foo is really Bob
[17:10] &lt;Zakim&gt; +Bob; got it</pre>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is temporarily &lt;name&gt;</kbd>
</li></ul>    

<p>Supplants &lt;old identifier&gt; with &lt;name&gt; for this call
      only.  After the caller disconnects the name associated with the phone
      number will revert to &lt;old identifier&gt;.</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>&lt;old identifier&gt; is [really] me</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Supplants &lt;old identifier&gt; with your IRC nick.</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>I am &lt;old identifier&gt;</kbd>
</li></ul>    

<p>Supplants &lt;old identifier&gt; with your IRC nick if it was a
      telephone number or other unknown party identifier, otherwise simply
      associate your IRC nick with the named party.  In the latter case
      (associating your IRC nick with the named party), you may then use "me"
      instead of entering your full name in commands such as "mute me",
      "unmute me", "disconnect me", and "queue+ me".</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>nick &lt;irc-nick&gt; is &lt;name&gt;</kbd>
</li></ul>    

<p>Associates an IRC nick with the named party, as in the case above.
      This command is available for someone else to make the association
      other than the person owning the nick.  When the association is
      known, Zakim will more often recognize when to unmute the caller.</p>

<p>When referring to a participant you need only use enough characters of the
participant's name to be unambiguous; e.g. a participant named 'TimBL' can be
referred to as just 'Tim'.  The anonymized version of the telephone number
for a participant whose name is unknown ends in four characters.  If an
abbreviated name does not match the left-most part of a known participant's
name and does match the last four characters of an anonymized telephone
number, Zakim will understand that the reference is to the participant at
that telephone number.</p>

<h3 id="mute">Muting</h3>

<p>The Zakim bridge has the capability to mute conferees.  (Muting blocks
sound on a conferee's line from being heard on the conference.)  Conferees
can mute themselves by dialing 61#.  In that case, unmute is 60#.</p>

<h3>Mute the named participant</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] mute &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li></ul>

    <p>The participant can unmute using
    60#.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:14] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, mute AlanK
[17:14] &lt;Zakim&gt; AlanK should now be muted
[17:15] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, mute AlanK
[17:15] &lt;Zakim&gt; AlanK was already muted, Alan-MIT</pre>


<h3>Unmute the named participant</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] unmute &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li></ul>

    <p>  This command will undo BOTH
      <strong>mute</strong> commands and 61#.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:17] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, unmute AlanK
[17:17] &lt;Zakim&gt; AlanK should no longer be muted
[17:17] &lt;Alan-MIT&gt; zakim, unmute AlanK
[17:17] &lt;Zakim&gt; AlanK was not muted, Alan-MIT</pre>

<h3>Mute or unmute the named participant for 15 seconds</h3>

<ul class="command">
<li><kbd>[please] mute &lt;name&gt; temporarily</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>[please] unmute &lt;name&gt; temporarily</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>[please] temporarily mute &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>[please] temporarily unmute &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p> These
      requests are intended to facilitate the identification of callers who
      are causing noise or echos.</p>

<h3>List all participants muted for any reason</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>who is muted?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who's muted?</kbd></li></ul>

    <p>Zakim does not distinguish

<h3>Noise, Voice detection</h3>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>who is talking?</kbd></li>
<li>  <kbd>who's talking?</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>Requests that Zakim-bot listen for 10 to 20 seconds then report the
      names of any participants who were heard during that interval. This
      request is intended to be an aid to determine which participants might
      need to be muted. <em>If a line is generating sound at a very low
      level, it may be reported here but not actually heard in the
      conference; this is not uncommon for some phone lines that introduce
      echo.  Occasionally a port that is generating continuous sound might
      not be reported; this is a bug.</em>  In place of the word 'talking'
      the words '<strong>speaking</strong>', '<strong>noisy</strong>' and
      '<strong>making noise</strong>' may also be used.

<h3 id="disconnect">Disconnecting Participants</h3>

<p>If a participant is unable to hangup, the line can be disconnected on
request.</p>

<li>  <kbd>[please] drop &lt;name&gt;</kbd></li>

	<li>  <kbd>[please] leave</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>All disconnect the Zakim bot from your IRC channel.  This has no
      effect on the conference bridge itself.</p>

<h3 id="help">Help</h3>
<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] help</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Displays an abbreviated list of some major commands.  Due to "flood control" in
      IRC, this may be slow.</p>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>where is [+]&lt;dialing code&gt;?</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Looks up a telephone number prefix in a North American area code
      directory or in an international country code directory. The '+' may be
      omitted only if the dialing code is exactly 3 digits; this will be
      interpreted as a request to lookup a North American area code.  Hyphens
      and periods may be used in the dialing code and will be ignored.</p>


<h3 id="speakerqueue">Floor Control</h3>

<p>Zakim will help track a queue of participants wishing to speak. The
commands in this set need not be directly addressed to Zakim; they will be
recognized when addressed to no one in particular and also when received as
third person ('/me') messages.</p>

<h3 id="handup">Add name(s) to the queue of individuals wishing to speak</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>queue+ [&lt;name&gt; [, &lt;name&gt; ...]]</kbd></li>

<li><kbd>sees &lt;name&gt;'s [, &lt;name&gt;'s...] hand[s]  [up]</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>If
      &lt;name&gt; is omitted or specified as 'me', the irc nick issuing the
      request is used. The last three forms are intended particularly for /me
      messages. <!--A phone participant who does not have irc access can dial
      <strong>41#</strong> to raise his or her hand.  The mnemonic is
      <strong>4</strong>=<strong>H</strong>and, <strong>1</strong>=up,
      <strong>#</strong>='enter'.  It is not necessary that the participant
      be unmuted to dial this request.  There is no audible feedback for a
      dialed request so the chairperson is encouraged to verbally confirm the
      queue request at an appropriate pause.--></p>


<h3 id="qplus">Add name to the queue of individuals wishing to speak</h3>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>queue+ [&lt;name&gt;] [also] to &lt;note&gt;</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>q+ [&lt;name&gt;] [also] to &lt;note&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>If
      &lt;name&gt; is omitted or specified as 'me', the irc nick issuing the
      request is used.  The &lt;note&gt; is a comment to indicate why that
      person wishes to speak; the word 'to' may also be written as ':'.
      If the same name is added to the queue multiple times there may be
      multiple notes.  The word 'also' can be given in such cases however
      it is not necessary.
      </p>

<h3 id="qqplus">Add name to the speaker queue to react to the current speaker</h3>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>qq+ [&lt;name&gt;] [also] to &lt;note&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>The mnemonic is "quick queue+".  This
  request adds to the front of the speaker queue to react to something
  the current speaker just said.  This should be used with discretion
  and is therefore considered an experimental feature.
</p>

<p>If
      &lt;name&gt; is omitted or specified as 'me', the irc nick issuing the
      request is used.  The &lt;note&gt; is a comment to indicate why that
      person wishes to speak; the word 'to' may also be written as ':'.
      If the same name is added to the queue multiple times there may be
      multiple notes.  The word 'also' can be given in such cases however
      it is not necessary.

</ul>

    <p>If
      &lt;name&gt; is omitted or specified as 'me', the irc nick issuing the
      request is used. If a &lt;name&gt; is given explicitly and if it
      matches the start of exactly one entry in the queue then it is
      interpreted as if that full entry were entered; that is, unambiguous
      abbreviations are recognized.  Abbreviations are not recognized if the
      name is omitted or 'me' is used; i.e. when the irc nick issuing the
      request is assumed. The last three forms are intended particularly for
      /me messages. <!--A phone participant who does not have irc access can dial
      <strong>40#</strong> to lower his or her hand.  The mnemonic is
      <strong>4</strong>=<strong>H</strong>and, <strong>0</strong>=down,
      <strong>#</strong>='enter'.  It is not necessary that the participant

</ul>    

<p>or replacing any names already on the queue.  If "queue" is spelled out
      and no names are specified then the queue is cleared.</p>

<h3 id="q">Display the queue of individuals wishing to speak</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[who is on] queue?</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[who's on] queue?</kbd></li>

      the participant.--> If &lt;name&gt; matches the start of exactly one name
      on the queue of individuals wishing to speak (see 'queue+' above) then
      the corresponding name is removed from the queue.  However,
      &lt;name&gt; need not be on the speaker queue, nor is the chair
      obligated to acknowledge speakers in any particular order.</p>


<h3 id="acknext">Grant the first person on the speaker queue permission to speak</h3>
	
<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[chair] recognize[s] next [speaker]</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[chair] ack[s] next [speaker]</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>  The name will be displayed along with the remaining
      speaker queue.  <!--If the queued name corresponds to a known
      participant and that participant is muted, Zakim will unmute the
      participant.--></p>

<h3 id="closequeue">Close the queue</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] close the queue</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Causes subsequent queue+ and 41# requests to leave the speaker
    queue unchanged.</p>


<h3 id="openqueue">Reopen the queue</h3>
<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] [re]open the queue</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Causes subsequent queue+ and 41# requests to be added to the
    speaker queue.  This is the default state when Zakim is invited to
    a channel.  The speaker queue will also be reopened whenever a new
    agendum is taken up.</p>

<h3 id="lastword">Giving the Last Word</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] give &lt;name&gt; the last word</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] &lt;name&gt; has the last word</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Grants &lt;name&gt; permission to speak, clears the remainder of
    the speaker queue, and closes the speaker queue.  Subsequent queue+
    and 41# requests will leave the speaker queue unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="queuetimer">Timer for speakers</h3>

<ul class="command">
<li><kbd>[please] allow [each speaker] &lt;number&gt; minutes|seconds</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] allow [speakers] &lt;number&gt;   minutes|seconds</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] time [each speaker] [at] &lt;number&gt;   minutes|seconds</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] time [speakers] [at] &lt;number&gt;   minutes|seconds</kbd></li>
</ul>
    <p>Causes the <strong>ack</strong> command to start a timer.
	 Zakim will
      issue reminders as the speaker approaches the end of the alloted
      speaking time.  The keywords 'minutes' and 'seconds' can be abbreviated
      to 'min', 'm', 'sec', or 's' respectively.  'give' may be used as a
      synonym for 'allow'.</p>

<h3 id="stoptimer">Stop timer</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] stop timing [speakers]</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Causes Zakim to cease issuing reminders as speaker are acknowledged
      and approach the end of a previously established speaking time.</p>

<h3 id="stopqueue">Stop tracking Queue</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] ignore [the] queue</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Requests that the Zakim bot stop tracking speaker queue changes. This
      request must be addressed specifically to Zakim.  This is not the same
      as closing the queue; after Zakim has been told to ignore the queue,
      it will give no feedback to queue+, queue-, and recognize requests.
      If the queue is closed Zakim will continue to give feedback unless
      it has also been told to ignore the queue.</p>

<h3 id="startqueue">Start Tracking Queue</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] track [the] queue</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Requests that the Zakim bot begin tracking speaker queue changes.
      This is the default state when Zakim is invited to a channel. This
      request must be addressed specifically to Zakim.  Note that the
      speaker queue may be opened or closed independently of whether
      Zakim is tracking the queue.</p>


<p>The speaker queue will be cleared at the end of the conference assigned to
the irc channel.</p>

<h2 id="agenda">Agenda Tracking</h2>

<p>Zakim will help track agenda items requested while a meeting is in
progress.  Like floor control, the commands in this set need not be directly
addressed to Zakim; they will be recognized when addressed to no one in
particular and also when received as third person ('/me') messages.</p>


<h3 id="agendaplus">Add an agenda item</h3>

<ul class="command">
	<li><kbd>agenda+ &lt;text&gt;</kbd></li>
	<li><kbd>agenda+ &lt;text&gt; '['&lt;proposer&gt;']'</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>Adds an item described by &lt;text&gt; to the agenda, assigning it
      the next sequential number.  The irc nick of the person who entered the
      request is recorded.  In the second form, the brackets '[ ]' are part
      of the command (the quotes are not) and indicate that the proposer is
      someone other than the person who entered the request.  The word
      'agenda' may also be entered as 'agendum'.</p>

<pre class="example">[12:10] &lt;RalphS&gt; agenda+ minute-taker

<h3 id="dropitem">Drop an item from the agenda</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>agenda- &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>item- &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>delete agendum &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>

<li><kbd>remove agendum &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>remove item &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>Removes item &lt;number&gt; from the agenda. <em>Note the '-'
      (hyphen) between the word 'agenda' and the number</em>.  In the second
      form the word 'agendum' may also be mis-written as 'agenda'.</p>


<h3 id="takeup">Open the discussion about an agenda item</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>take up agendum &lt;number|pattern&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>open agendum &lt;number|pattern&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>move to agendum &lt;number|pattern&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Indicates that agenda item &lt;number&gt; is open for discussion. 
      This gives Zakim the information needed to respond to subsequent
      commands.  The word 'agendum' may be mis-written as 'agenda' or
      as 'item'.  A text pattern (regular expression) may be given
      instead of a number if the pattern matches exactly one agendum.</p>

<h3 id="nextitem">Move to the next agenda item</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[take up] next agendum</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[open] next agendum</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>move to next agendum</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Indicates that the next non-closed agenda item in the list specified
      by 'agenda order' or the lowest-numbered non-closed agenda item is open
      for discussion.  If an agendum is currently open it will be closed unless
      it has been open for less than a minute.  (This reduces confusion if
      several people simultaneously instruct Zakim-bot to move to the next
      agendum.)  The word 'agendum' may be mis-written as 'agenda' or
      as 'item'.  The third form, 'move to ...', causes Zakim bot to display
      the next agendum for the record, whether or not you addressed the bot
      directly.  If the current agendum has been open for less than a minute
      use <strong>close this agendum</strong> explicitly to permit moving
      to the next agendum.</p>

<h3 id="clearagenda">Clear the agenda</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] clear [the] agenda</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Removes all items from the agenda.</p>

<h3 id="readagenda">Read agenda from another source</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] read agenda from &lt;uri&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>
    <p>Takes <em>uri</em> as a file of RDF/XML and queries it for
     agenda items.  Any agenda items found will be added to the current
     agenda. See <a href="/2004/02/agenda">description of agenda format</a>
     for details on the RDF graph that is expected.  Paul Downey wrote
     a <a href="http://blog.whatfettle.com/2006/07/04/rdf-agenda-scraper/"
      >tool for extracting RDF/XML agendas from text messages</a>;
     you can append the URI of your text message to Paul's
     <a href="http://whatfettle.com/2006/07/RDFAgenda/">RDFAgenda</a>
     URI to construct a URI for the RDF/XML form of a suitably-formatted
     text agenda.</p>

<h3 id="saveagenda">Save agenda to W3C Web site</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] save agenda [team-access|member-access|world-access]</kbd></li>
</ul>  

<p>Writes the current agenda to the Web in RDF/XML form as
    http://www.w3.org/yyyy/mm/dd-&lt;channel&gt;-agenda where 'yyyy' is the
    current year, 'mm' is the current month, and 'dd' is the current day.
    If an access option is specified, the URI will be given the corresponding
    visibility.  The suffix <em>-access</em> may also be written as
    <em>-visible</em> or may be omitted entirely.</p>

<h3 id="reminder">Program a reminder alarm</h3>

<ul class="command">
<li><kbd>[please] ping [me|us] in &lt;interval&gt;  [minutes|hours]</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] remind [me|us] in &lt;interval&gt; [minutes|hours] [about|to|that  &lt;text&gt;]</kbd></li>
</ul>

    <p>Schedules a notice for &lt;interval&gt; minutes or hours in the future.
      &lt;text&gt; will be displayed at that time if it is specified.  This
      request must be addressed specifically to Zakim. The word 'minutes' may
      be abbreviated to 'minute', 'mins', 'min', 'm', or may be omitted.
      The word 'hours' may be abbreviated to 'hour' or 'h'.
      There is no significant difference between 'ping' and 'remind', between
      'me' and 'us', or between 'about', 'to', and 'that'.</p>

<h3 id="ignoreagenda">Stop tracking agenda changes</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] ignore [the] agenda</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Requests that the Zakim bot stop tracking agenda changes. This
      request must be addressed specifically to Zakim.</p>

<h3 id="trackagenda">Start tracking agenda changes</h3>

<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] track [the] agenda</kbd></li>
</ul>    <p>Requests that the Zakim bot begin tracking agenda changes. This
      request must be addressed specifically to Zakim. This is the default
      state when Zakim is invited to a channel.</p>


<p>The agenda will be cleared at the end of the conference assigned to the
irc channel.</p>

<a id="pickscribe"></a>
<h3 id="pickvictim">Minute-Taking (Scribe)</h3>

<p>Zakim will help choose a scribe (minute-taker) from the current
participants in the meeting.</p>
<ul class="command"><li><kbd>[please] propose a scribe</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] pick a scribe</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] nominate a scribe</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] choose a scribe</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>[please] select a scribe</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>... other than &lt;names&gt;</kbd></li>
<li><kbd>... except &lt;names&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>    

<p>Randomly selects a minute-taker from the current participants. 
  The word 'victim' may also be used in place of 'scribe'.
  You can exclude names from the random selection by adding 'other than'
  or 'except' followed by one or more comma-separated names.
  This is most useful when there is a short list of participants 
  and repeated requests select an unavailable person.
</p>

<h2 id="questions">Question Tracking</h2>

<p>Zakim will help track a list of questions requested during a
  meeting. Like floor control and agenda management, the commands in
  this set need not be directly addressed to Zakim; they will be
  recognized when addressed to no one in particular and also when
  received as third person ('/me') messages.</p>

<h3 id="questionplus">Add a question</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>question+ &lt;text&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Adds a question described by &lt;text&gt; to a list of questions,
  assigning it the next sequential number. Questions may be supported
  by other participants. It is recommended that questions start with
  one of who, what, when, where, why, or how. The keyword 'question'
  may be abbreviated to 'quest' or 'ques'.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:13] &lt;Ralph&gt; question+ When is this needed?
[17:13] * Zakim notes question 1 added
[17:13] &lt;Ralph&gt; question+ How will this work?
[17:13] * Zakim notes question 2 added</pre>

<h3 id="listquestions">Display the list of questions</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>list [the] questions</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>show [the] questions</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>questions?</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>list all [the] questions</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>show all [the] questions</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Displays the questions and the number of supporters of each
  question.  The first three forms are equivalent and only display
  questions that have not been dropped or closed.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:13] &lt;Ralph&gt; list questions
[17:13] * Zakim sees 2 questions remaining:
[17:13] * Zakim Q1: When is this needed? (1 supporter)
[17:13] * Zakim Q2: How will this work? (1 supporter)</pre>

<h3 id="supportquestion">Support a question</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>question &lt;number&gt;++</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>question++ &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Indicates that you are interested in the answer to a question.
  Questions will be ordered by the number of supporters.  The keyword
  'question' may be abbreviated to 'quest' or 'ques'. A single '+' is
  recognized, though technically imprecise.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:17] &lt;OtherPerson&gt; question 2++
[17:17] * Zakim ok, OtherPerson
[17:17] &lt;OtherPerson&gt; questions?
[17:17] * Zakim sees 2 questions remaining:
[17:17] * Zakim Q2: How will this work? (2 supporters)
[17:17] * Zakim Q1: When is this needed? (1 supporter)</pre>

<h3 id="cancelquestionsupport">Cancel support of a question</h3>
	  
<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>question &lt;number&gt;--</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>question-- &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Indicates that you are no longer interested in the answer to a
  question. The keyword 'question' may be abbreviated to 'quest' or
  'ques'. A single '-' is recognized, though technically
  imprecise.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:18] &lt;OtherPerson&gt; question 2--
[17:18] * Zakim ok, OtherPerson
[17:18] &lt;OtherPerson&gt; questions?
[17:18] * Zakim sees 2 questions remaining:
[17:18] * Zakim Q1: When is this needed? (1 supporter)
[17:18] * Zakim Q2: How will this work? (1 supporter)</pre>

<h3 id="dropquestion">Drop or close a question</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>drop question &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
  <li><kbd>close question &lt;number&gt;</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Drops (removes) a question from the list of questions.  The two
  forms are equivalent. The keyword 'question' may be abbreviated to
  'quest' or 'ques'.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:19] &lt;Ralph&gt; drop question 1
[17:19] * Zakim notes question 1, When is this needed?, dropped
[17:19] &lt;Ralph&gt; questions?
[17:19] * Zakim sees 1 question remaining:
[17:19] * Zakim Q2: How will this work? (1 supporter)
[17:20] &lt;Ralph&gt; list all questions
[17:20] * Zakim sees 2 questions:
[17:20] * Zakim Q1: When is this needed? (1 supporter) - dropped
[17:20] * Zakim Q2: How will this work? (1 supporter)</pre>

<h3 id="clearquestions">Clear the list of questions</h3>

<ul class="command">
  <li><kbd>[please] clear [the] questions</kbd></li>
</ul>

<p>Clears (erases) all questions from the list of questions.</p>

<pre class="example">[17:50] &lt;Ralph&gt; clear the questions
[17:50] * Zakim notes questions cleared
[17:50] &lt;Ralph&gt; questions?
[17:50] * Zakim sees no questions</pre>

<h2 id="changes">Change History</h2>

<h3>2021-01</h3>

<p>Added question management.  Added 'other than' support for 'pick a scribe'.
  Fixed the bug that clearing the agenda failed to reset all agenda state.</p>

<h3>2020-04</h3>

<p>'prepare meeting' synonym for 'start meeting', experimental 'qq+' added.</p>

<h3>2019-12</h3>

<p>'verbose queue?', 'start meeting', and 'end meeting' added.</p>

<h3>2015-07</h3>

<p>W3C decommissioned the bridge hardware that provided many additional
  features of Zakim, including automatic announcement of caller arrival
  and departure, muting and unmuting callers, and teleconference schedule
  lookup.  Many commands associated with control of particants' phone
  connections have been disabled.  There is no longer a direct connection
  between Zakim and a particular teleconference system.</p>

<h3>2006-12</h3>

<p>'Skip agendum &lt;n&gt;' and 'skip this agendum'
added.  'Delete' and 'forget' added as synonyms for
'drop' in 'drop agendum &lt;n&gt;'.</p>

<p>Decline to close an agendum unless the speaker queue is empty or
'really' is part of the close request.</p>

<p>'Take up item &lt;pattern&gt;' had been case sensitive
and no longer is.</p>

<p>Zakim bot leaves a channel after a long period of inactivity
(nothing for Zakim to do).  Previously only a queued reminder
would keep Zakim from departing.  Non-closed, non-skipped agenda
items will now also keep Zakim on the channel indefinitely.</p>

<p>Other improvements and bug fixes that may only be noticed by a few.<p>

Yves Lafon gave it a good start with a Unix-style <a

restyled it to match the W3C participants

<p>The Zakim IRC bot was written by Ralph Swick.</p>

<p>The development of the Zakim IRC bot was supported in part by
funding from US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
and Air Force Research Laboratory, Air Force Materiel Command, USAF,
under agreement number F30602-00-2-0593, "Semantic Web Development".</p>

<p>The Zakim teleconference bridge <del>is</del>was a customized
<a href="http://www.compunetix.com">Compunetix</a>
Contex Conferencing system.  Thanks to Compunetix for providing
technical details that enabled the original development of W3C's Zakim tools.</p>

<p><a id="name"><em>Why is this called 'Zakim'?</em></a></p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (<a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>)
conducts a lot of its technical design discussions using the Web, e-mail, and
teleconferences.  We use so much teleconferencing that we have our own
in-house teleconference bridges, housed at <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a>.  When we were choosing names for the
systems someone proposed that we adopt the names of the vehicle bridges
across the nearby
<a href="http://www.charlesriverconservancy.org/crb/crb.html"
>Charles River</a>.  So in 1998 we had our own 'Longfellow' and 'Tobin'
conference bridges.  When we made a major upgrade of our teleconference
systems in 2001 to a new generation of all-digital bridge of course we were
immediately attracted to the name 'Zakim', in honor both of human rights
advocate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_P._Zakim"
>Lenny Zakim</a> who gave voice to the people and the <a
href="http://www.leonardpzakimbunkerhillbridge.org/">Zakim
bridge</a> across the Charles.  In 2015 when the W3C-owned bridge was
decommissioned we retained the name of this bot to not forget the past.</p>
