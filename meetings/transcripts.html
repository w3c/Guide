        <p> Many teleconferencing systems are offering automated speech-to-text
          facilities to provide captioning and transcription of meetings. Zoom
          as used by many W3C Groups under the MIT license offers this feature
          by default as of February 2021. </p>
        <p> W3C fosters a community where conversations among those present in a
          meeting may be conducted freely and openly. It has proven advantageous
          for meeting participants to be able to ask permission to “go off the
          record” to explain some background for a position or to provide some
          other detail that may be misunderstood if quoted out of context.
          Moreover, some participants have expressed concerns of personal
          harassment that could be exacerbated by a recorded transcript of their
          comments. </p>
        <p> Captioning and transcription can be helpful to meeting participants,
          including those who have difficulty hearing, or for whom spoken
          English is more difficult to understand. With regard to minuting
          practices, automated speech-to-text technology is improving but is not
          yet sufficiently accurate to be relied upon as the sole record of the
          meeting, and its use for minutes is therefore discouraged. </p>
        <p> In consideration of the real-time value to meeting participants of
          automated captions and transcription while respecting the utility of
          allowing not-for-the-record remarks, W3C’s policy is that automated
          transcriptions of W3C meetings are solely for the use of those present
          in the meeting and <strong>must not</strong> be saved or shared with
          anyone not present in the meeting. Before enabling automatic
          transcriptions, the meeting chair <strong>must</strong> ask those
          present for consent to enabling transcription and <strong>must not</strong>
          permit the meeting host to enable transcription if any participant
          withholds consent. The chair’s announcement must cover who will have
          access to the transcript, the purpose/use of it, and for how long it
          will be retained. </p>

        <h1> Zoom-specific instructions</h1>
        <p> In the Host’s account, the ‘Save Captions’ setting must be turned
          off. This setting is in the “In Meeting (Advanced)” section of the
          Settings &gt; Meeting tab. See the <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360034675592-Changing-your-meeting-recording-and-telephone-settings">Zoom

	  off at the start of a meeting. See
