      <p>
        W3C benefits from diverse, inclusive, and worldwide participation. This document provides guidance
        to those organizing distributed meetings.
      </p>

      <h2 id='timezones'>Dealing with timezones</h2>

      <blockquote cite='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#distributed-meeting'>
            <p>A distributed meeting is one where most of the attendees are expected to participate from remote locations
               (e.g., by telephone, video conferencing, or IRC).</p>
            <p>&mdash; <a href='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#distributed-meeting'>W3C Process Document</a></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>A Chair should build consensus about the time slots for distributed meetings and should
	 reevaluate that consensus on a regular basis. A good practice is to re-evaluate at the semi-annual spring and fall shifts in daylight saving time, and upon significant changes in membership or participation.
      </p>

      <p>When scheduling regularly occurring distributed meetings, the Chair should consider rotating meeting times
      if that helps a broader group of members to participate.</p>

      <p>W3C being an international organization, its meetings are impacted by holidays in various countries and cultures. You
        can find a <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Holidays">list of holidays</a> to take into consideration.
      </p>

      <p>A Chair might use the following steps for proposing time slots:
      <ul>
        <li>Collect participants' time zones</li>
        <li>Propose candidate time slots, at least some of which start beween 06:00 and 00:00 in each participant's timezone
                (see <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20210127&p1=240&p2=248&p3=33&p4=195&p5=136&p6=43&p7=64&p8=224">the World Clock Meeting Planner</a>)
        </li>
        <li>If using a tool such as doodle.com to collect feedback, provide alternative mechanisms to participants who
	have trouble accessing the tool</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A Chair should consider the following when judging the group's consensus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize preferences of core participants based on the meeting agenda</li>
        <li>Give consideration to all preferences, including those in the minority, taking care
              to not systematically disenfranchise any participants.</li>
         <li>If the group can not reach a consensus, the Chair has the discretion to make
               a decision.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#GeneralMeetings">W3C Process</a>
	  provides rules about the timing of meeting announcements and agenda publication.
      </p>
      </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id='calendars'>Group calendars</h2>

      <p>The calendaring system is <a
            href='https://www.w3.org/blog/2021/03/group-calendaring-service-enters-beta-test/'>currently in beta</a>.
      </p>

      <h3 id='create_event'>Creating an event</h3>

      <p>
        Things to keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ol>
            <li>Keep the event status as 'Draft' or
              'Tentative' until you're ready to get the announcement out to the participants and your Group mailing
              list.</li>
            <li>Announcements are only sent out when important changes are made (dates, status, recurrence rule,
                  invitees, joining instructions, location)</li>
            <li>Assume a newcomer will look at your event, so use standalone information as much as possible and use
                  links in the event description, agenda, and joining instructions fields, so a new participant can
                  follow links and find out the additional information.
            </li>
            <li>Joining link and instructions can only be seen by members, participants in the invited groups
              and additional invitees, so it's safe to put passcodes in the joining instructions.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        A suggested workflow for recurring events is to create the event with the recurrence rule, keeping the
        status as 'Tentative'. This will create the multiple occurence of your regular meeting (up to one year ahead).
        Once you're ready to send the agenda out, update the single occurence and change the
        meeting status to 'Confirmed'.
      </p>

      <p>Draft events are found through your <a href='https://www.w3.org/users/myprofile/calendar'>personal
        calendar</a> 'My Drafts', so only 'Tentative' and 'Confirmed' events will appear on the Group
        calendar page.</p>

      <p>The tooling requirements to manage time zones are still being developed and is not be
            part of the initial release of the W3C Calendar system. The W3C Calendar system does support timezones but
      not provide facilitation for finding suitable times within a set of timezones. In the meantime, we recommend using
      online resources, such as <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?p1=43&p2=195&p3=224&p4=33&p5=248&p6=136&p7=64&p8=216&p9=152">the World Clock Meeting Planner</a>
      and <a href="https://doodle.com/">doodle</a>.
