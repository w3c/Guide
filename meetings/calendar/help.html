        <h1>Shared calendars for W3C groups</h1>
</div>
            <p class="baseline">This <strong>Guidebook</strong> is the collected wisdom of the W3C Group Chairs and
                  other collaborators.</p>
    </div>
    <p>This document describes the way to use the CalDAV-based calendar server
      for sharing calendars with groups. Chairs and Team contacts can access the
      service at <a href="https://cloud.w3.org/">to create and share calendars.</a></p>
    <p>Chairs and W3C Staff can use the service and create one or more calendars for their groups and share them publicly. Editing rights should be shared with other Chair persons and Staff. The calendar tool itself is not accessible to the public, so make sure that you "publish" a calendar to make it available.</p>

    <p> First, log into the service using your W3C account credentials. In the
      main screen, click on the icon at the top-right corner and choose
      Settings. Adjust the security settings to setup 2FA as you wish, for
      example using TOTP.</p>

        longdesc="setting up 2FA option" height="300px"></p>
    <p><i>Note that if you use an external application to connect to the server,
        you need to generate an "app password" (at the bottom of the same
        security settings page) that you will providing to the external
        application.</i></p>
    <p>You can now start using the calendar app by clicking the calendar icon in
      the top bar. Create a calendar with the 'new calendar' item, make sure you
      choose an explicit naming (including the name of the group is generally a good idea). Share it with other chairs or team contacts,
      giving them the right to edit the calendar. You may search for users or groups by typing their names, email address or group id and find them in the drop-down list.</p>

      height="300px">
    <p> To give access to the calendar information to the rest of the W3C
      community (in particular your group) you have to publish it. Use the "publish" button with a '+' sign. Once it is
      published, you can copy the public link to the clipboard, or send it by
      email, copy the subscription link (DAV uri) or the embed code (iframe
      code, e.g. to add it to a group webpage). </p>

    <img src="calendar-published.png" alt="calendar is published" title="calendar published"
      longdesc="showing the ways to get to the published calendar" height="300px">
    <p> You can start creating events using this online tool, or in your own CalDAV client if you prefer. The "Settings and import" menu in the bottom left corner also
      gives you the CalDAV uris to be used when setting up client applications (i.e.
      "server address" in a CalDAV account).</p>
