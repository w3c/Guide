        <h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
        <p>A W3C Workshop is a one-off event
            which W3C holds
            when a need is felt
            to advance some aspect of the Open Web Platform
            and the correct way forward is unclear
            or would benefit from a wide variety of informed points of view
            before Standards-track work commences.
        </p>
        <p>
            The result of a W3C Workshop is a report,
            made publicly available,
            which summarizes the workshop discusions
            and recommends next steps which may be
            the establishment of a W3C Working Group,
            or a W3C Community Group,
            establishment of a liaison with some other body,
            or on occasion the conclusion that
            no Standards-track work should be done in the area.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            To date, most W3C Workshops have been face-to-face meetings.
            Going forward, more workshops are expected to be virtual.
            As W3C gains experience with virtual workshops,
            this Guide is likely to be updated.

        <h1 id="Proposing">Proposing a Workshop</h1>
        <p>Most workshops to date
            have been proposed by the W3C Technical Staff,
            in particular, members of the W3C Strategy Team.
            Workshops being planned are publicly visible
            on the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/projects/2">W3C Strategy Funnel</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the planning phase,
            each workshop is maintained
            as an issue on GitHub. For example, here is the issue for
            the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/175">Inclusive XR workshop</a>.</p>

        <p class="command">
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/strategy/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Exploration%3A+untriaged&template=00-Exploration.md&title=">Propose a W3C Workshop</a>

    </section>
        <p>
            Each workshop proposal is discussed,
            undergoes a round of <em>horizontal review</em>
            (checking for Accessibility, Internationalization, Privacy and such like aspects)
            before it is approved by the W3C Management
            and a Call for Participation is issued.
            Here is an <a href="https://www.w3.org/2019/08/inclusive-xr-workshop/">example
                workshop call</a>.
            <!-- due dates and timeline for a new workshop -->
        </p>
        <p>
            W3C has a requirement that no a Call for Participation is issued
            no later than eight weeks prior to the meeting's scheduled start date.
            This helps ensure that speakers and authors
            have adequate time to prepare position papers and talks.
            Once a workshop is proposed and accepted,
            a planning period of typically 12 weeks before the event
            allows meeting planners time to prepare logistics
            and business development time to organize any sponsorship.
        </p>

        <h1 id="attendance">Attendance</h1>
        <p>
            In contrast to a conference workshop,
            which is typically a tutorial attended by those who paye a fee,
            W3C Workshop attendance is by submission of a Position Paper,
            which is evaluated by a Program Committee.
            Not all papers are accepted,
            and not all accepted papers are presented in person,
            although all accepted papers are made available
            to the public after the event
            and (ideally)
            to participants before the event,
            to encourage early discussion.
