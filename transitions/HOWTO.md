# The Fu to edit the transition requirements 

HTML elements are displayed (or not) based on the user selection.

When an option is selected, it updates the URL of the document with a new set of parameters. Those parameters are reflected within the HTML document using the @data attributes.

So far, we have the following data attributes (each matching a URL parameter):

1. `data-profile` for a |-separated list of profile
2. `data-rec` for a |-separated list of REC paths
3. `data-cr` for a |-separated list of CR paths
3. `data-informativeOnly` for a |-separated list of FPWD and WD paths
4. `data-returning` for a |-separated list of FPWD and WD paths
5. `data-notehistory` for a |-separated list of first [working|interest] group note paths
7. `data-echidna` for automatic publishing

If no data attributes are present, the element will get displayed for all possible states *within the scope of the parent element*. For example, to display an element for all types of Recommendations, use `data-profile="REC"` and don't use the `data-rec` attribute on that element.

The data attributes may be combined but, if data attributes are used, one of them must be `data-profile`, otherwise the other data attributes will be ignored.

You may use multiple values for each attribute, separated by `|`. For example, to display an element for all types of Recommendations and Candidate Recommendations, use `data-profile="REC|CR"`.

e.g.
```
<div id='d1' data-profile="CR">
  <p id='e1'>This is a new publication.</p>
  <p id='e2' data-profile="CR" data-cr="new|snapshot">It will a snapshot (which might be the first snapshot).</p>
  <p id='e3' data-profile="CR" data-cr="draft">It will be a draft.</p>
  <p id='e4' data-profile="REC">This is bogus.</p>
  <p id='e5' data-rec="new">I did not mean to display this.</p>
</div>
```

If the user selected an updated Candidate Recommendation Snapshot (the URL contains the parameters `profile=CR&cr=snapshot` ):

* `d1`, `e1`, `e2` and `e5` will get displayed. `e3`, `e4` will not get displayed.
* `d1` gets displayed because the profile matches.
* `e1` gets displayed because it's within `d1`.
* `e2` gets displayed because the profile and the cr match.  
* `e3` will not get displayed because the cr does not match.
* `e4` will never get displayed since the scope of its parent element `d1` is `data-profile="CR"` (and a document can't be a CR and a REC at the same time).
* `e5` will get displayed because, since there is no `data-profile` on that element, `data-rec` gets ignored. So `e5` is similar to `e1`.

To find the possible values for each data attribute, look at the HTML option and input HTML elements in [the document](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/blob/main/index.html#L269). Or, if you're looking for a particular document transition, use the form to select and see the values of the URL parameters.

# New W3C Process

To add or remove a document status, one must:

1. remove or add the status in the HTML option elements (id="profile")
2. add or remove HTML input elements if applicable
3. Update the data-profile attributes

If HTML input elements were added or removed:
1. update the corresponding data- attributes
1. update the config object near the top of the script
1. update the JS functions onpushstate (URL) and titleMatch (attribute matching)

# New Echidna updates

For echidna updates:
1. Update data-profile on the ul element with id='echidna-selection"
2. Update the data-echidna as needed (you're likely to add data-echidna="false"')
3. Update the JS function hasEchidna()
