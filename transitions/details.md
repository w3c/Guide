- Possible next steps after each transition; see the description of the [Recommendation Track Process](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#Reports).
- The Comm Team's policy regarding [in-place modification of W3C Technical Reports](https://www.w3.org/2003/01/republishing/).

## Interactions with the W3C Communications Team  {#commteam}

At various stages during the Recommendation Track process, the W3C Communications Team assists Working Groups as follows:

- Organizing formal Advisory Committee reviews (including scheduling and preparation of review forms).
- Issuing a press release around a First Public Working Draft, Candidate Recommendation, Recommendation, or other transition (for example, to announce completion of important work or to raise awareness at a conference). The Communications Team generally begins work on a draft press release several weeks in advance of an anticipated release, soliciting review within the Team. The Communications Team may also request Working Group review of a draft press release. In general, the Communications Team strives to make press releases available in English, French, Japanese and Chinese. The W3C Offices translate [W3C press releases](https://www.w3.org/press-releases/) into additional languages.
- Soliciting testimonials in support of a document, usually more than a month in advance of publication of a Recommendation.
- Announcing publication to Members and the press.
- Listing the publication on the W3C home page and in Member publications. In general, the Communications Team drafts home page announcements for publications (see [past news items](https://www.w3.org/news/)). Input from Team Contacts for announcements of First Public Working Drafts is appreciated.
- Writing speaking points for the press, generally with input from the Working Group.
- Coordinating spokespeople to answer technical questions from the press.

Please contact the Communications Team at w3t-comm@w3.org (cc'ing the group's Team Contact) if you have any general questions regarding the publications process.
