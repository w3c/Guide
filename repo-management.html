  <p>
    This document covers a tool that was created to support contributions made to a group, under the
    form of pull requests, in order to assess whether they are IPR-OK or not. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The tool is at:
    <a href="https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/">https://labs.w3.org/hatchery/repo-manager/</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    A number of operations in the tool require logging in through GitHub as the related actions you can undertake through the tool (or that the tool can
    undertake on your behalf when reacting to a GitHub event) require authorized access to GitHub.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several tools of use:
  </p>
  <section>
    <h3>New Repository <span class=acl>login required</span></h3>
    <p>
      This is basically what people should use when they want to start a new specification in a CG or a WG. It gives you a choice of the organisations under which you are allowed to create a new
      repo (including your own user), and you can pick the name of the repo and the group(s) to
      which it belongs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hitting "Create" can take a little while as the tool does all of the following, live:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Creates the repo on GitHub
      </li>
      <li>
        Adds several files, notably the <code>LICENSE</code> and <code>CONTRIBUTE.md</code>, a
        <code>w3c.json</code> file which can be used by other tools, and an <code>index.html</code>
        that's a bare-bones ReSpec spec ready to be edited.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adds a hook to the repo such that pull requests and comments on them are sent to us,
        including one distinct cryptographic secret per repo.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saves all the relevant info on our side.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most users should only ever have to use that. Once done they can go and play in their repo.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Import Repository <span class=acl>login required</span></h3>
    <p>
      This is the same as "New" but for an existing repo. It will *never* overwrite something there
      so it is the user's responsibility to check that the repo is okay.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>How Pull Requests Get Handled</h3>
    <p>
      Whenever a pull request is made against a repo that is under the tool's management,the tool gets
      notified. It uses this information to assess if the PR is acceptable (i.e. all its
      contributors have made the relevant IPR commitment).
    </p>
    <p>
      Count as contributors not just the person making the pull request, but also anyone added
      either in the PR description or in any subsequent comment using "+@username" on a line on its
      own. If a contributor was added by mistake, she can be removed wit "-@username" on a line on
      its own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time a PR is created or has a comment with a username change, the status of the PR is
      changed. If it's okay it'll get changed to green with a note indicating that it's fine; if not
      it gets changed to some ugly brown with a red cross (and a link that people can use to check
      the issue in more detail).
    </p>
    <p>On the page that explains the IPR failure, one can mark a given Pull Request as non-substantive: this will post a comment on the pull request under the name of the user, and will clear the flag for the said pull request.</p>

    <p>When a pull requets gets flagged as not OK by the tool, it will attempt to notify the github users listed in the <a href="w3c.json.html#contacts"><code>contacts</code></a> property of the <code>w3c.json</code> file in the repo.</p>
  </section>

  <p>
    The following are only available to admins.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>Currently Open Pull Requests</h3>
    <p>
      This list all PRs that are now open, even old ones. It lists useful details such as which
      users are being problematic either because they are unknown (not in the system at all) or
      outside (known to the system but not in one of the right groups for that repo).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can go to PR details by clicking "Details".
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>PR Details</h3>
    <p>
      If the PR is not in an acceptable state, this will list problematic users with a link to fix
      each of them, and a button to "Mark the PR as non-substantive".</p>
      <p>For problematic users, the fix can either be  "Add to system" or "Edit" (details below).
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea is that the vast majority of non-acceptable PRs for a newly added repo will come from
      people who are simply not known.
    </p>
    <p>
      If all problematic users are added to the system and
       group, return to the PR details page and hit
      "Revalidate". We could <a href="https://github.com/w3c/ash-nazg/issues/26">revalidate every time a user is added or edited</a>, but it's pretty costly
      so for the time being it is done this way. Revalidation will of course update both the local
      state and the PR's mergability indicator on GitHub.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Add User to system <span class=acl>login required</span></h3>
    <p>
      For users that are unknown to the system, they can be added by following on of those links and
      just clicking that button. This is always an innocuous operation; it does not give the user
      any special rights nor can it make a PR OK (since the user needs to be in a group for that).
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Active Last Week PRs</h3>
    <p>
      This is a list of pull requests, in any state, that saw activity last week. They can be
      filtered according to the affiliation of the companies that made the contributions. This is
      essentially so that AC reps who have people in CGs who are only supposed to contribute to some
      specific work but not all of it can monitor what's been going on and avail themselves of their
      45 days retraction window. Similar affordances are available as for the list of open PRs.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Edit User <span class=acl>login required</span></h3>
    <p>
      The interface to edit users is where the W3C data model and the GitHub data model get to meet.
      This alone is scary; I've tried to make it less scary.
    </p>
    <p>
      A list of the groups known to the system is show, the user can be added and removed from them
      there. If the user's affiliation is unset, once some groups have been added you can click
      "Set". This will load up a list that is the *intersection* of membership in the selected
      groups. The UI will also try to select the user with the name matching their GitHub profile
      (which may not always work, but often does). Hitting "OK" will associate the GH user with the
      W3C user, making it possible for us to use affiliation information. Don't forget to hit
      "Save".
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a little convoluted but it's the best I could do with the current APIs from both
      GitHub and the W3C backend. Hopefully it can be simplified in the future.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Admin > Users <span class=acl>admin required</span></h3>
    <p>
      This is a list of users. Things you can do there include making them admins and giving them
      blanket contribution rights. <strong>USE EITHER WITH CARE</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Admins should normally not be able to break the system, but they can enter all sorts of bogus
      information that would be really annoying. Only grant admin when you're sure; it's probably
      better to ask others first.
    </p>
    <p>
      Blanket is a different type of superpower: users with blanket access are considered acceptable
      contributors to ALL repos, irrespective of their group memberships. This should normally be
      restricted to W3C team people.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Admin > Groups <span class=acl>admin required</span></h3>
    <p>
      This is a list of all W3C groups. You will note that most have an "Add" button next to them:
      those are the ones that are in W3C but not in this system. Please do *not* start adding groups
      unless they explicitly want to be managed under this system. We only want people to
      create/import repos for groups that are actually using this system. Clicking "Add" makes that
      group one of those available for repos and users to belong to.
